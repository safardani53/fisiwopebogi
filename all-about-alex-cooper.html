Originally synonymous with its sex-heavy topics in what was branded "female locker-room talk," her podcast now puts <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>"a modern twist on feminism"</a> in each episode that airs, according to marketing materials.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Call Her Daddy covers a wide-range of topics in typical podcast fashion, Cooper notably turns heads for her tell-all interviews with some of the highest-profiled talent in Hollywood. Guests have included <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Miley Cyrus</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Chelsea Handler</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>John Mayer</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Kelsea Ballerini</a> and fake German heiress <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Anna Delvey</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In June 2021, Cooper and Spotify made a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>three-year deal worth more than $60 million</a> in total, per Variety, which makes it the streaming platform's biggest exclusive deal for a female-led podcast ever. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>"I want to be the biggest podcast in the world,"</a> Cooper revealed to the Wall Street Journal the year of the agreement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With an annual salary of $20 million, Cooper is now the highest-paid female podcaster on Spotify — and second only to Joe Rogan overall, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Los Angeles Times</a> reported in June 2022. "A woman just got what in the past would've been a male contract," she told the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cooper <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>announced her engagement</a> to Hollywood producer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Matt Kaplan</a> in an April 23, 2023, interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=noopener>W Magazine</a>. She revealed that Kaplan popped the question on March 3 at their home in Los Angeles. "It was very surreal," she said of the proposal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about Cooper, from her days as a Division I college athlete to her globally recognized career.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-her-podcast-was-acquired-by-barstool-sports-before-spotify></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Her podcast was acquired by Barstool Sports before Spotify</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Alex Cooper/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to Cooper's three-year Spotify deal in 2021, Barstool Sports acquired Call Her Daddy approximately one month after its first episode aired in 2018.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since the podcast's debut, the show's structure has evolved tremendously. Among one of the major changes? Cooper now hosts solo, a duty that came after parting ways with Sofia Franklyn — her former co-host, best friend and business partner — in April 2020.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The podcast went dark that year, leading tabloids and fans — deemed the "Daddy Gang" — to speculate about a fallout between Cooper and Franklyn, especially since the two posted that they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>"legally can't speak out"</a> on the behind-the-scenes talk at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Details remain murky as to what exactly caused the partnership to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"go up in flames,"</a> as Time put it, but it was in part due to a contract renegotiation with Barstool Sports. Ultimately, Cooper picked Call Her Daddy back up, while Franklyn started her own show a few months later.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-evolved-her-podcast-to-focus-more-on-female-empowerment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She's evolved her podcast to focus more on female empowerment</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>MARCO ERBA/SGP/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For years, Call Her Daddy was synonymous with sex. It was known for raunchy talk and coining <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>concepts like the "Gluck Gluck 9000"</a> (an oral sex technique, FYI), keeping with the program's original "female locker-room talk" ethos.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Today, Cooper still exudes big-sister energy with the sex advice she distributes, but her content has evolved and expanded — despite people telling her "they miss the old Call Her Daddy," she told the Los Angeles Times. Now, she covers a wider range of topics and caters to a broader demographic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was like, 'How many times can we talk about sex?'" she told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Los Angeles Times</a>. "I was getting a little bit bored. I need to be mentally stimulated by my content."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since then, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>topics on the show have included</a> "reclaiming your power" after experiencing trauma, sexual fluidity, self-love and debunking mental health stigmas. Most of all, she wants to expand her conversations into the realm of female empowerment.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-interviewed-some-of-hollywoods-biggest-stars></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She's interviewed some of Hollywood's biggest stars</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Alex Cooper/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Furthermore, Call Her Daddy has taken on an interview-heavy format, featuring conversations between Cooper and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. The Q&A style is intimate, and Cooper gets stars to be candid about headline-making topics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For example, when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jamie Lynn Spears</a> was a guest on the show, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hoped to put to rest the accusations</a> that she didn't help her sister <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Britney</a> throughout her conservatorship. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Hailey Baldwin Bieber</a> revealed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>her favorite sex position</a> with husband <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=6>Justin Bieber</a>, while <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=7>Jane Fonda</a> opened up about the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=8>"secret life"</a> she used to live while struggling with an eating disorder.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-engaged></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She's engaged</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Alex Cooper and Matt Kaplan.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Aaron Idelson</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cooper <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>confirmed her engagement</a> to Kaplan in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>W Magazine</a>, which was published on April 24, 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the interview, the podcast host said Kaplan proposed on March 3 at their home in L.A. The podcaster arrived home to find candles, music and a scavenger hunt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I like, blacked out," Cooper recalled of the moment Kaplan proposed. "I think I said yes at first. It was very surreal."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Their engagement came after <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>three years of dating</a>, during most of which Cooper kept Kaplan's identity a secret from her fans. When mentioning him on her podcast, she would refer to him as only "Mr. Sexy Zoom Man" until revealing his identity in April 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cooper discussed her "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wedding planning disaster"</a> on Call Her Daddy in August 2023. She shared that the couple struggled to determine a location for their nuptials. After considering Utah, London, and Tennessee, they settled on having a tropical wedding.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't want it to be somewhere people can publicly consume our wedding," Cooper said, noting that Hawaii's public beaches were off the table. "I want it to be somewhere that matters to us."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She went on to explain that her priority on the big day is to be "present" with Kaplan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It’s so important to me that Matt and I actually have this day to ourselves.&nbsp;I refuse to not be present with my partner," the podcast host said.

But while Cooper has created a name for herself as a go-to for advice, she's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>also gained some guidance</a> from the person who knows her best.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If she's talking to me about relationships, it's like, 'Do not lose yourself just to be with someone.
