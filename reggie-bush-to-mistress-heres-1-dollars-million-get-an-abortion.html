He got a woman pregnant. And he tried to cover up the mistake via a huge payout.</p><p>According to one celebrity gossip report, that is.</p><p>As previously reported, <a href=#>Bush knocked up a Miami waitress</a> named&nbsp;Monique Exposito at some point this year. She is allegedly six months along with his baby.</p><p>The problem with this scenario?</p><p>Bush is married to&nbsp;Lilit Avagyan&nbsp;and has two kids with her. <strong>OOPS</strong>!</p><p>Insiders now tell Bossip that Bush tried to nip this pregnancy in the bud when he first learned of it, offering a large sum of money to Monique in order for her to get an abortion.</p><p>“It is well known in Miami circles that Reggie has been hooking up with Monique for the last two years,” a source claims to&nbsp;Bossip, adding:</p><p>“When Monique told him that she was pregnant, Reggie offered her $1 million to have an abortion, but she declined.”</p><p>Bush left Buffalo Bills training camp in August to go home for a bit, presumably to try and save his marriage.</p><p>He has not commented on this impending baby news; nor has&nbsp;Avagyan filed for divorce.</p><p>Instead,&nbsp;Monique is the one who has made a series of legal moves.</p><p>“She lawyered up,” this same source tells Bossip, explaining how Monique shared pictures on Instagram while taking meetings with her attorney in Los Angeles.</p><p>“She definitely was trying to send him a very strong message that she was not playing around.”</p><p>Monique was prepared to go public with details of her affair, <a href=#>but Bossip writes</a> that a "settlement" was reached; i.e. Bush did pay her off to at least remain quiet.</p><p>"She deleted all posts on her Instagram page where she’d mentioned her lawyer," the site reports.</p><p>Where do things stand now between Bush and his wife?</p><p>The man best known in gossip circles for having dated <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> shared the following image on social media just a few weeks ago.</p><p>He later added as a message "God can turn around any situation."</p><p>If God were really on Bush’s side, we can’t help but wonder how he ended up a member of the Buffalo Bills.</p><p>Jokes aside, however, we guess we’re glad he’s worked things out with&nbsp;Avagyan. There are two kids at stake between them.</p><p>There’s supposedly a third on the way for Bush. Those children deserve as stable an enviroment as possible.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>13 Paternity Scandals That ROCKED Hollywood</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2puX2Z%2BcL7EoJ6inV2XwrS0jK2mZqWZqMGzsdKsZKGdoprAbn2MnaalpJGnwG65yKWjoqeeYrSmwIyapWaZkqS%2FtbXOp2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
