This is my last chance to achieve my greatest dream, but this is a World Cup and it’s really tough.”</p><p>Argentina went through to the semis after an explosive win in a penalty shootout against <a href=#>the Netherlands</a>.</p><p>The match was marked by tempers boiling over in an ongoing feud between Messi and Dutch head coach <a href=#>Louis van Gaal</a>.</p><p>The pair shared bad blood over van Gaal’s treatment of Messi’s mentor and <a href=#>Argentine</a> footballing icon Juan Roman Riquelme when the Dutchman managed Barcelona.</p><p>Messi was left fuming after van Gaal “disrespected” his team by claiming the play-maker didn’t contribute to the game when the other side had the ball.</p><p>After scoring Argentina’s second goal, Messi channelled Riquelme’s mocking victory celebration before calling Netherlands goal scorer Wout Weghorst an idiot in a bad-tempered post-match outburst in the tunnel.</p><p>Messi said: “It was a really tough game. We were facing a great team. We have a very good group of players. They know how to fight when the going gets tough.</p><p>“They (the Netherlands) talked a lot before the game and I didn’t like it.</p><p>“The player in the number 19 shirt (Weghorst) kept provoking us. Bumping into us, and saying things from the start.</p><p>“I don’t think that behaviour belongs in football.</p><p>“I was really angry before the match because a coach like van Gaal... I felt he had disrespected the Argentinian team.”</p><p>Messi fulfilled his World Cup mission after leading Argentina to victory over <a href=#>France</a> in a spectacular final.</p><p>He scored twice in the 3-3 match before scoring again from the spot as Argentina won on penalties.</p><p>He said: “It’s very hard to explain how you feel at that moment. All that energy.”</p><p>Asked if he had any advice for his young­er self, he said: “Enjoy football, keep doing what you do, because that’s what matters the most and the rest will come.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>GARETH BALE</h2><p><strong>Wales</strong></p><p>BALE led Wales to their first World Cup since 1958 and told how much-loved former manager Gary Speed, who <a href=#>took his own life in 2011</a>, aged 42, still inspires the nation.</p><p>On reaching Qatar he said: “The proudest thing you can do as an athlete is to represent your country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1c451170-9961-11ee-97d3-0af08cbb888fpng-JS869454340.png><p>“To be playing for <a href=#>Wales</a> and taking them to the World Cup, for it to become a reality is surreal.</p><p>“Whenever I meet up with Wales it feels like home.</p><p>“I know everyone sees that I’m quiet, but I like to joke around and get people going. It’s about us as a team, trying to do as best we can.”</p><p>He said the team still talk about Gary Speed, adding: “We still speak about him. Everyone involved will tell you how grateful the whole nation is.</p><p>“If he hadn’t come in at that moment, we might not be where we are now, we might not have had that foundation built for us to really kick on and achieve what we’ve achieved.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>HARRY KANE</h2><p><strong>England</strong></p><p>TOP scorer Kane went up against his <a href=#>Spurs</a> team-mate <a href=#>Hugo Lloris</a> in the quarter-final.</p><p>Kane missed a penalty which saw <a href=#>England</a> crash out when they lost 2-1 to France.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5cb47b76-1286-4848-9bc6-ccaf7ca275fd.jpg><p>But the England talisman never lost hope until the last moment.</p><p>He said: “We’re level-headed, we know what we need to do to go far in this tournament. It’s important you control your emotions.</p><p>“We’re not just here to reach the quarter-final and we have to believe if we want to go all the way.”</p><p>On penalties he said: “I like to have the ball in my hands, stay calm.</p><p>“I always kind of know where I’m going to put the penalty, focus on that.”</p><p>Lloris says of Kane’s miss: “That’s football.”</p><p>England boss <a href=#>Gareth Southgate</a> said: “England always think they should be winning.

Yes of course! But a World Cup win could be fun.”</p><p>Of his shredded dreams after a quarter-final exit, he said: “Some people like me, some people don’t, but I’m proud of everything I’ve done. It wouldn’t be fair for me to ask for more.</p><p>“I don’t chase records, records chase me. Pressure? Every player feels pressure. There’s been pressure ever since I left Madeira aged 11.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>THIAGO SILVA</h2><p><strong>Brazil</strong></p><p>AN emotional Silva told how he was left “hurt” after pre-tournament favourites Brazil were <a href=#>knocked out by Croatia in the quarter-finals</a>.</p><p>But he said he had already won the biggest battle of his life after winning a fight for survival against tuberculosis aged 21 in 2005.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GETTY_Croatia-v-Brazil-Quarter-Final-FIFA-World-Cup-Qatar-2022_SPO_GYI1448010176jpg-JS781798164.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Chelsea</a> defender said: “People say Thiago is weak for having emotions. I wouldn’t have got where I am today by being mentally weak.</p><p>“I had to be strong in one of the biggest battles of my life.
