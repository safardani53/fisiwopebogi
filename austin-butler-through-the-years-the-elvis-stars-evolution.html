The duo met when the Yoga Hosers actor was a teenager — well before Butler dated Tisdale’s other BFF <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Hudgens</strong></a> — and went on to costar in <a href=#>2011’s Sharpay’s Fabulous Adventure</a>.</p><p>“You’ve been my best friend since you were 15 so that’s 15 years strong of friendship,” the <a href=#>Suite Life of Zack and Cody</a> alum <a href=#>gushed via Instagram in August 2021</a> in celebration of Butler turning 30.&nbsp; “I am beyond proud of you and everything you’re accomplishing but most importantly proud of the person you are.”</p><p>Tisdale continued: “You’ve been my closest friend through the years, you’re the type of friend that came over when I was crying on the floor from a horrible breakup and not only lifted me off the ground but brought my favorite candy 😭.”</p><p>The Young and Hungry alum praised her longtime pal for understanding her better than almost anyone. “There’s no one like you Austin, you’re my twin born 7 years later 😉,” she added.</p><p>The pair’s friendship, however, has confused some fans after Butler and Hudgens <a href=#>called it quits in late 2019</a> after more than eight years of dating. Tisdale has known the <a href=#>Princess Switch</a> actress since before their <a href=#>High School Musical </a>days, but clearly, her roots run deep with both actors.</p><p>Butler, for his part, showed that there are <a href=#>no hard feelings between him and Hudgens</a>. In April 2022, the former Nickelodeon star revealed that his ex-girlfriend was part of the inspiration behind him taking on the role of <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a> in the film <a href=#>Elvis</a>, <a href=#>which premiered in June of that year</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I was actually driving up through Griffith Park and <a href=#>Elvis’s ‘Blue Christmas’</a> came on,” he recalled to Vogue of what sparked the desire to embody the music icon. “I was singing along with it when <a href=#>my friend [Vanessa]</a> had kind of an epiphany: ‘You need to play Elvis.’”</p><p>Scroll down to see Butler’s ups and downs throughout his career:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkrra%2F06KlZpqlqbmmvoytn6unpZy1bsDHnmSynZGnwG7Ax55knqSmnsBuv9Oaqaxllau8rcHToqanZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
