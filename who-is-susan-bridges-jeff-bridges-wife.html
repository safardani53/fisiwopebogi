The pair met while Jeff was making the 1975 film Rancho Deluxe in Paradise Valley, Montana, where Susan was working at the time. "I'm doing this scene with Sam Waterston and Harry Dean Stanton and I cannot take my eyes off this gorgeous, I didn't know what she was, a maid, a waitress, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>I couldn't take my eyes off of her</a>," Jeff said of their first encounter during a 2018 interview with Today.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While it was an immediate connection for him, Susan didn't exactly feel the same way at first, and Jeff has admitted that asking Susan out wasn't an easy task — once he "finally got the courage to ask her out," she said no.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the initial rejection, the two ran into each other again and hit it off.

While Jeff is now in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>remission</a>, the couple have opened up about the year and a half that he was sick, as well as his near-death experience with COVID-19.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I had no defenses. That's what chemo does — it strips you of all your immune system. I had nothing to fight it ... COVID made my cancer look like nothing," Jeff told PEOPLE of contracting COVID while in treatment for his cancer. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I was pretty close to dying</a>. The doctors kept telling me, 'Jeff, you've got to fight.

"And now's the good dream part."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the experience was difficult for the couple, Jeff has said that some good did come out of it. "Who would say, 'I'd love some cancer and give me a dose of COVID?' But my ability to receive all the love and give it was just heightened," he told PEOPLE. "Everything was turned up in the most beautiful way."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-jeff-have-three-children-together></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and Jeff have three children together</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>John Shearer/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Susan and Jeff are parents to three adult daughters: Isabelle, Jessica and Hayley.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple's children are very important to them and the girls are equally as grateful for their parents, whose long-lasting relationship has <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>served as an inspiration to them</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They love each other, but they like each other, they spend time together.
