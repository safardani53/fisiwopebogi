Alongside those useful experiences, he also has mustered a healthy net worth. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As per Celebrity Net Worth, Bet-David is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">worth</a>&nbsp;a whopping $150 million! <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><h2>A Flourishing Business Empire</h2><p>The financial adviser has gone through many rainy days to accumulate such a massive amount of wealth. His company, PHP Agency Inc., played the most crucial role in doing so.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, it wasn’t the same in the initial phase of his life. His&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">career</a>&nbsp;started in March 1997 after being appointed as a Fort Campbell-based US Army’s 326th Engineer Battalion specialist. After serving there for two-and-a-half years, he left the job in October 1999. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 2001, he joined Morgan Stanley as their financial advisor and worked there till 2002. Early that year, he joined hands with Northridge based Transamerica Agency Network Inc. as their field vice-chairman. After seven and a half years, in September 2009, he left the workplace.</p><p>Just a month later, Bet-David established PHP Agency Inc. to bring life insurance to middle-class Americans of every community and provide entrepreneurial opportunities to people from those communities.</p><p>Valuetainment Media LLC, a company that creates and syndicates the Valuetainment channel on YouTube and other media outlets followed the insurance company. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Alongside Valuetime Media, on November 9, 2012, he also&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">created</a>&nbsp;a YouTube channel of the same name where he began sharing video-interviews of different successful people with a vision to educate and motivate the upcoming generation’s entrepreneurs.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>With the same motive, he also authored entrepreneurship-related books. On April 22, 2014, he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">published</a>&nbsp;two books: ‘Doing The Impossible: The 25 Laws for Doing The Impossible’ and ‘The Next Perfect Storm.’</p><p>Following that, he published three more&nbsp;books: ‘The Life of an Entrepreneur in 90 Pages: There’s An Amazing Story Behind Every Amazing Story’ (on June 13, 2016), ‘Drop Out And Get Schooled: The Case for Thinking Twice About College’ (on February 7, 2017), and ‘Your Next Five Moves: Master the Art of Business Strategy’ (on August 18, 2020). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Negative Reviews of his Company</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Bet-David’s company, PHP Agency Inc., might claim or even work for their customers’ best interests, but there remain a few unsatisfied customers.</p><p>Some have dropped negative comments/reviews and claimed the company to be a scam on internet platforms such as Glassdoor.</p><p>At&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Glassdoor</a>, one of PHP Agency’s part-time employee has mentioned the cons of the organization. His review reads: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The lack of trust from potential clients and associates thinking the company is a "scam" or "pyramid scheme."</p><p>That being said, there have been tons of good reviews of the company as well—the PHP Agency’s overall rating on Glassdoor reads 3.8 stars out of 5.</p><p>Really lives up to the name of People Helping People. Great support network. Team Building. Motivational. You get what you put into it. This work takes heart and dedication. High earning potential.</p><p>Therefore, one cannot [and even must not] point out to the company and refer to it as a “scam company.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKiloa6ze8%2Baq6uhk6B6o7HTZpuarpmZeq%2Bx02auqKqknXupwMyl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
