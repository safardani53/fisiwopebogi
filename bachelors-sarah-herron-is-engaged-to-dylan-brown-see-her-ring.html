I’d wait a lifetime all over again—through the heartbreaks, years of self-work and countless rose ceremonies—to end up with this person,” she continued in her caption. “We make each other better, we have so much fun and we’re going to become parents together, so we decided to do the damn thing!”</p><p>The <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> alum then raved over Brown, calling him “my forever paradise, favorite adventure bud and BEST friend.” She later shared a video of him popping the question by the lake.</p><p>The Colorado native first appeared on season 17 of The Bachelor, vying for <strong><a href=#>Sean Low</a>e</strong>‘s heart in 2013. She went on to appear on season 1 of Bachelor in Paradise in 2014 and season 3 in 2016.</p><p>The SheLift founder has been open about her relationship with Brown, recently revealing that the pair were trying to have a baby and that she had been <a href=#>diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR)</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I never imagined it would go this way for me — that at 34 I’d be told my chances of having a baby naturally, are very slim,” she <a href=#>posted via Instagram</a> in March, admitting that it was “hard not to feel broken” after finding out the news. “After 7 months of trying, but with no pregnancy, we turned to fertility testing. The results are consistent. My egg count and quality is low.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below for more photos from the engagement:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr6Kvx56jqKqjYsCivsChZKGdoqe8r3nIrGSeppeWtKawjK2mZpypoa6vecGrprCmXaiypnnHnqlmqpmjtHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
