I’m like, ‘No, no, no. I just said <a href=#>the show was never the same after Cory died</a> because obviously it was not,’” he explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kevin-mchale-jenna-ushkowitz-glee-died-with-cory-monteith-main-001.jpg><p>In July 2013, Monteith <a href=#>died of a heroin and alcohol overdose</a> at age 31 after struggling with substance abuse for much of his life. He was dating his Glee costar <a href=#><strong>Lea Michele</strong></a> at the time of his death.</p><p>“He was the heart of our show. [Monteith’s character] Finn was the heart of the show and Cory was the heart of our group,” Ushkowitz told Us.</p><p>McHale added that <a href=#>the cast didn’t talk openly about the grief</a> they were all experiencing after the Canada native’s untimely death. “When you’re in the middle of it, I think everyone, it’s just, you’re barely hanging on [but] keeping it together, being professional and just, you know, keeping your head down,” he said.</p><p>The Boy musician explained that it wasn’t until the Glee family experienced another loss — <a href=#>Naya Rivera’s death</a> in July 2020 — that they began to communicate openly with each other.</p><p>“It was weird timing. Like, ‘Why is this happening now?’ But everyone was so emotionally raw and just sort of like, ‘How is this happening? Why is this happening? Let’s talk about it. <a href=#>Let’s talk about everything</a>.’ And … I didn’t know there was so much unresolved,” he explained.</p><p>The Texas native added: “I remember speaking to <a href=#><strong>Ryan [Murphy]</strong></a> and to Jenna and <a href=#><strong>Becca [Tobin]</strong></a> … it’s like … nobody should have to carry any of this negativity toward this wonderful experience anymore. … Just duke it out, talk about it because we were kids, we were young, <a href=#>we were learning</a> and, you know, those are some of the hardest things to get past.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Glee-Alums-Kevin-McHale-and-Jenna-Ushkowitz-Say-the-Show-Was-Never-the-Same-After-Cory-Monteith-Death-2.jpg><p>The cast of the teen drama has continued to make headlines since the show ended in 2015. In June 2020, <a href=#><strong>Samantha Marie Ware</strong></a> — who had a recurring role on season 6 — accused Michele, 36, of <a href=#>making her life “a living hell”</a> on the set. McHale and Ushkowitz — who launched their new Glee rewatch podcast, “And That’s What You Really Missed”, last month — gave Us their thoughts on the Spring Awakening star’s <a href=#>alleged mistreatment of her costars</a>.</p><p>“I think when I said I’m not gonna sugarcoat it … we’ve danced around a lot, right? Because I would always say to Kevin, ‘Sometimes it’s not our story to tell,’” Ushkowitz said. “There’s like dancing around, obviously, the Glee curse and the deaths of our friends and some of the on-set drama that you hear. And I think this time, it’ll be hard, but like, <a href=#>I’m gonna tell it from my perspective and my experience</a> ’cause that’s all I can do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Glee-Alums-Kevin-McHale-and-Jenna-Ushkowitz-Say-the-Show-Was-Never-the-Same-After-Cory-Monteith-Death-Cast.jpg><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>McHale admitted that he did <a href=#>question Michele’s behavior at times</a>. “We all come from different backgrounds and different experiences and there were definitely moments of, like, ‘Is that normal?’ But we didn’t necessarily know any better and we were all learning together. And I know that sounds like some political roundabout answer,” he said.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknaaeu265wqGYpZ1dn7KvusBmrKygm6TEqsDZZp6lnZVisaqxw2auoqyYYrCwvthmpKimpJq2tbSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
