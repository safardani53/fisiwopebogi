The semi-professional gamer died while playing at her home in Aylesford, Kent. The <strong>23-year-old</strong> allegedly stayed up until 2:00 a.m. playing an online game while sipping vodka and Coca-Cola. Natanya Brook’s mother Jenny went to check on her the next morning and discovered her lying up against the bed. She assumed her daughter was sleeping. She did, however, return to Natanya’s room a few hours later when she was in the same situation. Her mother became suspicious and tried CPR.&nbsp;The emergency services were then summoned. She was pronounced dead at the scene, unfortunately.</p><h2>Natanya Brook Death</h2><p>Seizures had been a problem for the gamer in the past. She was also diagnosed with epilepsy when she was six years old. According to the Daily Mail, Natanya Brook would lose her train of thought, requiring her mother to save her on several occasions.&nbsp;The late performer was subjected to a post-mortem examination by Dr. Deirdre McKenna. Brook’s major organs were found to be normal. McKenna was unable to determine the precise cause of her death. It was determined that she died as a result of natural causes related to her previous epilepsy issues.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Natanya-Brook-2.jpg alt="Natanya Brook" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jenny Brook mentioned that Natanya’s gaming friends remembered her saying before she went silent:&nbsp;“Ooh. “I’m feeling…”</p><p>Natanya’s mother said of her daughter’s death:</p><p>“She made a difference in people’s lives, whether it was by encouraging them to sing or by making them smile.”</p><p>She just had this ability to entice people to come to her. “I don’t think she could have done anything else in her 23 years.”<br>She continued, saying:</p><p>“It’s as if a light switch was turned off.” That gives me some comfort because I know she wasn’t in any pain because they would have heard it.
