You don’t know who that is?’ I’m like, ‘No.’ They’re like, ‘That’s&nbsp;Chris Pine.’ I was like, ‘Oh, he’s hot,’” she added. Audrina revealed that Chris “didn’t like the whole paparazzi side” of their relationship, and so things “just kind of dissipated” between them. In her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2022 memoir</a>, Audrina said,&nbsp;“<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>I&nbsp;have nothing but fond memories of Chris</a>.
