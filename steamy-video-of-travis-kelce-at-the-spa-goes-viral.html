In the clip, Kelce rocks a white bathrobe and floppy hair as he dances in the hallway for the camera. The first treatment Kelce gets is a “Moroccan Journey,” a massage and deep cleansing treatment.</p><p>“Is that bubbles?” Kelce excitedly asks as he lays down shirtless on the massage board, which the masseuse confirms. “I love bubbles!”</p><p>The masseuse then switches to a clay soap. As Kelce waits for the product to emulsify, the camera person asks the tight end what his teammates are going to think about his self-care day.</p><p>“I don’t know if I can really think of what they’re going to say but I’m pretty sure I’ll hear it,” he quips. “It’s always fun.”</p><p>Once Kelce is rinsed off and the massage is complete, he heads to the sauna. Kelce comes out with only a towel wrapped around his waist.</p><p>“Woo! Hard to breathe in there. The hammam is amazing, I suggest this for everybody,” he gushes. “I might have to get my mom [<strong>Donna Kelce</strong>] one of these.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Travis-Kelce-Throwback-Steamy-Spa-Day.jpg><p>The video is currently making its rounds on social media amid Kelce’s relationship with <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>.

While Kelce was not successful at the time, Swift, 34, revealed they “<a href=#>started hanging out right after</a>” his public declaration. They were spotted together for the first time in September when Swift <a href=#>attended her first</a> Kansas City Chiefs game.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The twosome are getting serious quick, with a source telling <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that they have been talking about their future. “[They] had plenty of really deep conversations about their future together” and plan on making time for one another as they navigate their busy schedules.</p><p>“When they can’t physically be together, they are constantly texting, calling, and FaceTiming,” the insider told Us. “Taylor’s relationship with Travis is like nothing she’s ever experienced before.
