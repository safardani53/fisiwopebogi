off.</p><p>Ben has been played by several different actors over the years.</p><p>A TV insider said: “Max has played Ben for the last four years and bosses decided his time on the show was up.</p><p>“There has been a lot of noise around him for a bit too long and that can take away from the drama on the show.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on EastEnders">Read More on EastEnders</h2><p>“He went in for a meeting as his contract was up for renewal next year.</p><p>“No one knew how it was going to go and following discussions it was decided that he would leave.</p><p>“Bosses have yet to plan his exit storyline but Ben is not a character that they would kill off as we’ve already seen in all the previous recasts.”</p><p>An <a href=#>EastEnders</a> spokeswoman confirmed yesterday: “Max will be leaving EastEnders next year.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Soaps</h2></p><p>“We wish him all the best for the future.”</p><p>Max, 28, was caught up in real-life drama behind the scenes at <a href=#>Albert Square</a> when his love life began to resemble an EastEnders plotline.</p><p>In May 2022, he started to date 32-year-old <a href=#>Shona McGarty</a>, who plays Whitney Dean.</p><p>At the time, Max’s insurance executive partner Roisin Buckle, 38, was pregnant and thought they were just on a break.</p><p>She said she was left feeling “humiliated and disrespected” by the scandal.</p><p>However, the co-stars’ whirlwind romance ended six months later and soon after The Sun on Sunday revealed Shona was quitting <a href=#>EastEnders</a> after 15 years to pursue other projects.</p><p>Despite their split Max and <a href=#>Shona</a> have remained good friends.</p><p>Earlier this year he said: “We’re actually better than ever.</p><p>“It’s a friendship.</p><p>“We’re in such a good place.</p><p>“You take a risk, and you do something and it doesn’t work out, but that’s life.</p><p>“You’ve got to take that risk.”</p><p>He was later linked to Love Island star Olivia Hawkins after the pair slipped away to his dressing room during a soap set party.</p><p>During his time on the soap Max — who is the sixth actor to play Ben — has been involved in some of the show’s biggest storylines.</p><p>He was involved in <a href=#>Danielle Harold’s</a> heartbreaking brain tumour storyline as the character she played, Lola Pearce-Brown, was mum to his daughter, Lexi.</p><p>Ben struggled to cope with her death and developed eating disorder bulimia.</p><p>The source said: “Max has tackled some serious storylines in the last year, especially when his character stopped eating before breaking down and admitting that he had a problem.</p><p>“It opens the door to a number of ways his character could leave Walford next year.</p><p>“Plans for his exit will get under way after the Christmas break but he’s expected to be on screen until the spring.</p><p>“And, of course, if they decide to bring him back at some point the character could always be recast for a seventh time.”</p><p>Last weekend The Sun on Sunday reported that Max had escaped unhurt from a three-car collision.</p><p><a href=#>He was pictured looking shocked</a> as he emerged from his wrecked Mercedes CLA in the middle of the day.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read

Surrey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGplZ310gZNsZp6Zo6myr7DEq6pmpZGteqO71p2cp2WRrbKlew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div
