That means it has observed some fascinating cosmic wonder every day of the year, including on your birthday," the official prompt from NASA reads. "What did Hubble look at on your birthday? Enter the month and date below to find out! Then share the results with your friends on social media using #Hubble30."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Indeed, inputting your birthday brings up a specific image and description of exactly what Hubble saw on your special day. Users can then choose to either read the text, hide it, or bring up a separate tab with a full-screen version of the image that can be saved to a device. Also, clicking "more info" brings up a detailed page informing visitors on what the exact planetary phase or other cosmic anomaly photographed means in the grand scheme of the universe.</p><p>Of course, nobody is going to blame you if you utilize the new NASA widget to also check on what the sky was like during other important dates in your life. No matter the usage, it offers seasoned astronomers and the average enjoyer alike a fun, free little fact about their special day.</p><p>Be sure to check out NASA's public glimpse into the stars and share your results with your friends and family on social media!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo660rYypn6isn6h6sLqMprBmmpmnwamwwLI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
