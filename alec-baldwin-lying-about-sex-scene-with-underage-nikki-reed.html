Of course he totally knew how old she was.”</p><p>Brunetti added:</p><p>“He knew before we even cast the movie. I think he’s been method acting Trump too much and he doesn’t know the difference between fake news anymore.”</p><p>Fellow producer Ethan Astrowski backed up Brunetti’s&nbsp;version of events, stating:</p><p>“What Alec says happened is not accurate. I completely corroborate that. We were on set every day.”</p><p>The scene was perfectly legal due to the fact that Reed remained at least partially clothed, but lying about it is still not a good luck for Baldwin.</p><p>And he was having such a great, relatively scandal-free&nbsp;year, too!</p><p>Oh, well.
