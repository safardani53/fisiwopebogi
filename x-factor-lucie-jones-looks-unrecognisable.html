I will never stop pinching myself. Get your tickets."</p><p>Fans couldn't believe her change in appearance since her X Factor days - even if she was painted green.</p><p>One said: "You look INCREDIBLE @luciejones1 My wonderful friend @TheatreFlashba1 treated me to your latest album and it hasn’t left car CD player since. Can’t wait to see you as Elphie!! Have fun! X."</p><p>Another added: "Oh my word!!!..I am still getting over your fabulous performance as Jenna back in 2019 and then this !..You look and will sound amazing too.obvs !!"</p><p>Someone else said: "You look amazing Lucie - all the best in your new role. x."</p><p>Lucie starred in series six of Simon Cowell's talent show and lasted until week five.</p><p>She went on to compete in Eurovision back in 2017 where she finished in 15th place.</p><p>The 30-year-old blamed Brexit for her disappointing showing, where she didn't manage to get a single point from Germany or France.</p><p>In an exclusive interview just hours after the result, Lucie said: “I had no idea how Brexit was going to affect the vote until I was there. I did notice lots of Brexit comments.</p><p>“I mean the Aussies were the only ones to give us 12 points out of everyone — now that was pretty awkward.”</p><p>Making it all even more annoying for the former X Factor contestant was that she had voted to REMAIN.</p><p>Speaking as she headed home from Kiev, Lucie said: “I did vote to remain in the EU, but hey, not much we can do about it now.</p><p>“Lots of people voted to leave and we’re a democracy and that’s the way of the world. S*** happens.”</p><p>While the singer had not realised how feelings about the referendum would affect her scores, others had feared the worst.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>Despite this, Lucie said she was proud of her performance of ballad Never Give Up On You — especially because she didn’t come last like certain previous UK entrants.</p><p>She explained: “You know what, I’m feeling good.</p><p>“We didn’t come last which I’m thrilled about.</p><p>“We got great public response and I have had loads of messages of support from celebrities.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“It’s great that we got the support from home.</p><p>“All the messages have been just overwhelming.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict000323626657-e1494785005987.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>British entries to Eurovision should be picked in public talent show and nul points WASN’T Brexit revenge, says minister</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGlnaX94gpdvZrFllpawtbvRZqOum5maequ7zZ6qZqSfpLi0edSnqZ6bn5y7qr%2FAm6OeZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
