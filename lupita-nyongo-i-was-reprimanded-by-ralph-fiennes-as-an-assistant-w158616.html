Although she’s now an Oscar-winning actress, starring in one of the most highly anticipated films of the season — </span><i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i><span> — </span><b>Lupita Nyong’o</b><span> was once an overeager production assistant on the set of 2005’s </span><i>The Constant Gardener</i><span>.</span></p><p><span>In a new interview with United’s</span><i><a href=#> Rhapsody</a></i><span> magazine, the </span><i>12 Years a Slave</i><span> star, 32, dished about her days as a “very green” production assistant, in which she was constantly pestering the film’s star </span><b>Ralph Fiennes</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>“I was on a mission to talk to Ralph, but he was talking to some man,” she told the mag. “I went up to them, and suddenly the assistant director was white in the face with rage. He said, ‘You never interrupt the director!’ I didn’t even know who the director was!”</span></p><p>As a PA on the set, Nyong’o would escort Fiennes, 52, to the shoot every day, taking the opportunity to ask him a series of questions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>“Ralph is a very still man on set,” she noted. “It would be very quiet, and that made me uncomfortable. I’d try to make chitchat, asking, ‘What’s your favorite film? Of all the films you’ve been in, which have you enjoyed the most?’ He was so polite, and he responded to me. At one point, though, he just said, ‘Lupita, give me my space.’”</span></p><p><span>Now that she’s a celebrated working actress herself, Nyong’o said she understands the need for some peace and quiet to prepare.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>“When an actor lands on a set, there’s a psychological and emotional transformation that needs to happen,” she said. “I learned from that experience what an actor needs — and to ask for it. You have to calibrate yourself. The time before a camera rolls, the moments before my foot steps on a stage, have to be meditative. I have to withdraw from the world as I know it. It’s about listening quietly to my inner motor.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalraCewaJ5zbKmp5%2BfYrZuw8CsZKudoKe2rq3NnZydZZKuerOty6mfZp6ZmruvsdJmmKxlkaN6or%2FSoqqtmZ6perh9lHFtam5f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
