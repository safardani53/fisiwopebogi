She has yet to reveal the father’s identity of either child. “My feeling is that, until I speak to my daughter about that, I’m not going to talk to anyone else about it,” she told <i class=x_ContentPasted0>The New York Times</i>&nbsp;in June 2019.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p>That same month, the actress’ Late Night costar <strong>Scott Reid</strong> told Us&nbsp;Weekly exclusively what a great mom Kaling is.&nbsp;When asked if the <a href=#>Office</a> alum is always calm, cool and collected, he said, “In my experience? Yes.&nbsp;It’s starting to freak me out. I don’t know how. She looks amazing. She’s always so chilled out and zenned out. I don’t know what’s going on inside there, but I want some.”</p><p>The Veep alum added of his second son, Damon: “My littlest boy [and] her daughter are in this really sweet music class together where they just dance and toddle around. It’s really cute.”</p><p>Kaling’s <a href=#>Mindy Project</a> costar <a href=#><strong>Ike Barinholtz</strong>’s little ones also hang out with Katherine</a>. “Our daughters are friends,” he told Us that same month. “It’s so adorable on their playdates, we get sent pictures of them.”</p><p>After joking that their children “write a comedy show together [that] … sucks,” Barinholtz told Us why he believes the Why Not Me? author has been able to tackle motherhood with such grace.</p><p>“It’s a joy watching Mindy as a mother,” he said. “Mindy’s always been able to handle a ton. I remember when we’d be in the&nbsp;writers’ room, she’d be like, ‘I have to go to a wardrobe fitting,’ and&nbsp;then she’d call and be like, ‘Hey, one thing about that joke.’ …&nbsp;She’s like a polymath. It’s amazing.”</p><p class="x_p1 x_ContentPasted0">Kaling expanded her family in October 2020 <a href=#>when she secretly gave birth to her second child</a>, son Spencer. “I’m telling this for the first time, it feels so strange. I gave birth to a baby boy on September 3,” the actress revealed on an episode of <i class=x_ContentPasted0>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</i>&nbsp;at the time. “This is news to a lot of people. It’s true! … His name is Spencer. I forgot the most important part of it.”</p><p class="x_p1 x_ContentPasted0">The following month, Kaling opened up about going from a mom of one to a mom of two — and joked about how the “excitement” from loved ones dies down significantly.<span class="x_Apple-converted-space x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_p1 x_ContentPasted0">“The difference between having a first child <a href=#>and a second child is so funny</a>,” she “told Elle in November 2020. “The first time it was like every person in my life came out of the woodwork to send gifts and cards and notes and emails. And then once you have a second kid, everyone’s like, ‘You’re fine. You’re OK.’ It’s definitely more of a muted excitement from everyone in my life.”</p><p class=x_p1>Keep scrolling to take a look at the sweet things Kaling has said about raising her children:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkuqq6w7JkpJmcnruov4yqrKislah6oq7OrqtmpZ%2Bptaa%2Bx6imnWWilra0tc2gZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZqKarJiav6q6xGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
