Now it’s a case of keeping on top of things. I feel like I’m learning all the time.&nbsp;</p><p>“As a team, it would be better winning every game but I feel it’s been one of my best seasons so far.</p><p>“I’ve made an effort to put myself in the right areas and try to not be immature in a game sense. I’m also looking to the older players for guidance and seeing how they do it.</p><p>“It’s more players from outside the club, like Alex Walmsley. You can’t get much better examples when it comes to application.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN RUGBY LEAGUE</h2></p><p>“And I’m feeling more confident in myself now. I took it upon myself to get up to speed with Super League when I came to Salford and through the off-season, I gave myself a bit of a head start."</p><p>Dupree’s latest stop sees him face Castleford tonight but boss Paul Rowley believes he is on the way to the very top, England.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Rugby League</h2></p><p>The national side faces France on Saturday week and he said: “Hopefully Tyler gets the rewards he deserves, an England cap absolutely.</p><p>“The experience would be good for him. He’s progressed monumentally in the last 12 months – a taste of the international culture and set up would be good for him, I’m sure.</p><p>“He’s on a good journey and is in a good place. The scary thing is he can get even better.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/OH5_2507.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zfJFtcHFpX6nGrbHRZpuuqKKasm6%2FwKWdqKqUYsC2vMSrZKWdkZzCpnnEp56lmZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
