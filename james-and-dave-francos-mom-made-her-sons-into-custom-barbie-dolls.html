She shares her three sons with late husband Douglas Franco, who died in 2011 after suffering from a heart attack at age 63.</p><p>In the clip, the first set Betsy showed off was her version of Tom and his wife, <strong>Iris Torres</strong>, whom he wed in 2021. Tom’s doll rocked a red sleeveless hoodie, white printed board shorts and white slip-ons. He also held a pink surfboard. Torres’ counterpart donned a white graphic tee and black ripped skinny jeans with a matching hat and boots. Torres shared her mother-in-law’s creation via her Instagram Story.</p><p>“Our Barbie Xmas,” she captioned the pic. “Can you guess who is who? lol 😜.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/James-and-Dave-Franco-s-Mom-Made-Her-Sons-and-Their-Wives-Into-Custom-Barbie-Dolls-inline-1.jpg><p>Betsy then shared the next set of dolls which paid homage to Dave and his wife, <a href=#><strong>Alison Brie</strong></a>, whom he wed in 2017. Dave’s doll channeled the youngest Franco brother by sporting a floral Hawaiian shirt, jeans, light blue sneakers, a bright blue baseball hat and sunglasses. His toy also came with two kitten accessories, one placed at his feet and the other on his shoulder.</p><p>Brie’s doll rocked a multi-colored T-shirt with the phrase “GRL PWR” emblazoned on the front with black cropped leggings and white sneakers. She also wore a purple hat backward and held pink miniature weights in her hands.</p><p>“So spot on!! 🏋🏻‍♀️,” Brie, 40, commented on the post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/James-and-Dave-Franco-s-Mom-Made-Her-Sons-and-Their-Wives-Into-Custom-Barbie-Dolls-inline-2.jpg><p>Brie liked the dolls so much that she shared a picture of them via her Instagram Story to gush over the thoughtful present.</p><p>“Obsessed with Dave & me as Barbie & Ken dolls,” she penned. “Thank you @franco.betsy!! Perfect gift.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>James also reposted his mom’s video on his respective page. He and his girlfriend, <strong>Izabel Pakzad</strong>, also got their own dolls. James’ figurine channeled his laidback nature with a floppy hat, blue flannel jacket, a blue and gray T-shirt, navy slacks and brown shoes. He was accessorized with a bright orange backpack and green convertible. Pakzad’s version rocked a colorful t-shirt, black shorts and white shoes. She also had a camera around her neck and a pink bucket hat.</p><p>The Franco family is a tight-knit bunch. Betsy gave fans of her sons a glimpse of how they spent the holidays together last month when they gathered for Thanksgiving. The matriarch shared a table selfie of the entire gang via <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZ2awG6tzZ1knZmmmnqnvsCnmqirXaK8rnnMmpueZZiav26%2FzqeqZqGeqbxur9Ssq6ilXZeus67InmSdp5yhwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
