I think it’s an unnecessarily attention-seeking and provocative name - the food should speak for itself.</p><p>“What’s going to draw me in? Is it the nice family-run places that have been here a long time and engage with the local community?</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>"Or is it going to be the one that comes along and creates stories? It’s a bit pathetic."</p><p>&nbsp;Philip Tyrer, 57, said: “It wouldn’t draw me in - I don’t like the name.”</p><p>"There’s plenty of choice - if it’s got&nbsp;'slut'&nbsp;in the name, I don’t think I’d go in."</p><p>Johanna Kolerski Bezerra, who works at a nearby <a href=#>school</a>, told how a PTA group chat Chobham Friends was divided.</p><p>She revealed how some locals were excited by the idea of a fresh <a href=#>restaurant</a> while others refused to dine there due to its "offensive" name.&nbsp;</p><p>Johanna, 41, told The Sun: "We’re from the school and obviously we have a group of parents, the PTA group, and a few of them are boycotting that place because of the name.</p><p>"It’s quite interesting how it’s dividing people to the point where some might be really bothered as opposed to some who say, 'It’s just a name and I do love&nbsp;eggs&nbsp;and I want to try'.</p><p>"It’s fun to have something popular like that here.&nbsp;</p><p>"EggSlut&nbsp;is really, really famous in <a href=#>LA</a> - people are queuing hours to get a sandwich, so can we have that here and a taste of it and get some buzz around a name like that?</p><p>"It’s about how much importance we give to a word."</p><p>School colleague Amanda King, 42, said: "I don’t find it too offensive, but I know lots of people that do.&nbsp;</p><p>"When I first saw it I did go. 'ooh', but I read up on it and I understand why it’s called that.</p><p>"There were some parents who were very very cross about it.</p><p>"The sign itself isn’t that bad, but the advertising - they had white boards round the whole of the windows saying, 'EggSlut'.&nbsp;</p><p>"Obviously with the children’s play forum there this is where all the schoolchildren come and that’s what sparked it - there was a very big debate about it in our WhatsApp group.&nbsp;</p><p>"Lots of parents think it’s just a conversation to have with the children.</p><p>"Some of the parents wanted the school to intervene, but it’s nothing to do with the school.”</p><p>A message posted in a community <a href=#>WhatsApp</a> group and posted on <a href=#>X, formerly Twitter</a>, showed one resident fuming over the "grotesquely odd sexualisation of&nbsp;eggs".</p><p>The concerned resident wrote: "Hello everyone, I hope you're all having a wonderful day.</p><p>"I am interested in initiating a petition to request the removal of the name 'Eggslut' from an establishment.&nbsp;</p><p>"The grotesquely odd <a href=#>sexualisation</a> of&nbsp;eggs, nonetheless - along with using such unnecessary language that's unbecoming of a place we call home.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's frankly an inappropriate choice for a <a href=#>business</a> name, especially in our village where children, will and do, see it.&nbsp;</p><p>"Kindly cast your vote with a 'yes' or 'no' to help me gauge the interest in starting this petition. Thank you."</p><p>Another critic is local resident Craig Roberts, 33, who said: "There’s a few units around the east village which they could’ve taken where it’s less facing onto the children’s play space.</p><p>"I think having it by the kids play area is insensitive."</p><p>Yet despite concerns from some, 33-year-old Brooke Ben praised the new Eggslut for offering "a heaven-sent hangover cure".&nbsp;</p><p>And Daniel Ihediwa, 49, said: "I’m a creative, so I love it already - you should always break with the norm."</p><p>He added: "What I don’t like is that the interior doesn’t match the name - apart from that, the name is amazing.&nbsp;</p><p>"I’m all for it 100 per cent because I know that’s not a brothel, it’s not a nightclub.”</p><p>Residents and visitors got the chance to get a taste of the restaurant before its grand opening on Saturday with freebies and deals handed out this week.</p><p>Emily Beck, 24, said: "I didn’t have any opinions on the name until I looked on <a href=#>Facebook</a> and saw obviously it makes sense children asking, 'What’s that?’&nbsp;</p><p>"I can definitely understand why for parents it’s a bit awkward.</p><p>"It’s kind of funny but kind of weird - the word itself is offensive but I don’t necessarily find the play on words offensive.</p><p>"Obviously, being next to a children’s park is not necessarily a smart idea.</p><p>"Now that I’ve heard parents’ opinions, it makes no sense that it’s there but it makes a lot of sense why they’re concerned about it."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>Eggslut&nbsp;told The Sun: “Eggslut&nbsp;has been trading in the UK for five years and has prominent restaurants in <a href=#>Notting Hill</a>, Fitzrovia, Victoria and Shoreditch.</p><p>"'Eggslut' is a foodie designation and the name refers to someone who is obsessed with&nbsp;eggs&nbsp;and wants to eat them all day, every day – with everything."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/eggslut-restaurant-opening-east-village-854848551.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/eggslut-restaurant-opening-east-village-854848371.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/eggslut-restaurant-opening-east-village-854848692.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/eggslut-restaurant-opening-east-village-854848674.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/eggslut-restaurant-opening-east-village-854848523.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/eggslut-restaurant-opening-east-village-854848582.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4F2f5NxbnBnnprEbr7ErKuaraKWu7V512apmqyVmXqvrcyeZKSdlaV6rLXDrGSar5GufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
