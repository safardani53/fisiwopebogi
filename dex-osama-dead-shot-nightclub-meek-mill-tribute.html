Dex was shot while walking down the street, once in the chest, and once in the stomach, and ran to a nearby gas station to get help.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-2>“So I’m sitting there applying pressure, and he’s talking to me,” Jay Sareini, who was at&nbsp;the gas station and tried to save the victim, revealed. “He’s alive, he’s talking to me. ‘Please don’t let me die, please don’t let me,’ grabbing on to me.” Sadly, there wasn’t enough Jay could do before help arrived, and Dex died soon after.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Just shortly before his death, Dex had signed a contract to work with Meek, and, according to producer Parellee, Meek’s goal was to not only help Dex in the music biz, but also in ‘hopefully getting him off these streets.’ Nicki’s man — whose album you can buy here — &nbsp;took to Instagram to remember his young protege, and shared a touching message along with a photo of the two of them.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Damn RIP YOUNGIN…. Had a lot of talks with you about getting out them streets and chasing ya dreams! I really believed in you and seen you putting on for Detroit! RIP @dex_osama.
