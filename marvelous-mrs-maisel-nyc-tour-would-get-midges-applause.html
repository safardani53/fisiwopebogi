I just actually came from a wig and shoe and hat fitting. Literally just 20 minutes ago, walked in the door,” she said on December 11. “So we are in the process of getting ready to go back hopefully safely in January, and are really, really excited. The hats are insane. The hats are out of control. We may have lost our minds with the hats this season.”</p><p>The private tours are limited to two people minimum and three people max in a group.
