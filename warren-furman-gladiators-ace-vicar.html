As a nation we need a wholesome family show again.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News TV</h2></p><p>“Everyone spends so much time on their <a href=#>phones</a> and computers in different rooms, so I am all for a show coming back where families can come together.</p><p>“I will be cheering on the new Gladiators.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cotton buds</h2><p>The show first slammed on to Saturday-night TV in 1992, presented by our very own <a href=#>Ulrika Jonsson</a> and ex-footballer <a href=#>John Fashanu</a>.</p><p>More than 16million viewers watched the show, which turned its Gladiators including <a href=#>Michael Van Wijk</a>, James Crossley and Kim Betts into household names as Wolf, Hunter and Lightning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/17-10-98_-_GLADIATORS_A-JS1605496.jpg><p>Viewers loved to see its Lycra-clad stars taking on members of the public in strength and agility challenges in the arena.</p><p>The Gladiators fought contenders with pugil sticks — weapons that looked like giant cotton buds — as well as trying to make them fall from suspended rings in the Hang Tough round and blocking their path as they rolled around inside giant hamster-ball “pods” in Atlaspheres.</p><p><a href=#>ITV</a> only planned for the show to run for three years but it was so successful that by 1996 the channel was looking for new cast members, and Warren, then a 24-year-old homeless and jobless roofer, applied.</p><p>Formerly a skinny teenager, he had started bodybuilding to look like his film heroes and says: “In the Eighties, muscles were ruling the world.</p><p>“<a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> was the highest-paid movie star in history and as far as I could see it wasn’t for his acting ability.</p><p>“I thought Gladiators would be a stepping stone to <a href=#>Hollywood</a>.”</p><p>Once Warren was accepted as a Gladiator, TV bosses sent a stretch limousine to the homeless hostel in Harlow, <a href=#>Essex</a> where he was living and flew him first-class to a training camp in <a href=#>Mauritius</a> with the rest of the show’s muscled-up stars.</p><p>He says: “The producer said to me, ‘Here are some Gladiator names but when you choose, choose wisely because you’re going to become a commercially important person’.</p><p>“When they suggested Ace I thought, ‘That’s rubbish. A Gladiator needs a scary name, like Warrior or Rhino. Who’s going to be scared of facing Ace?’</p><p>“A couple of weeks later they said McVitie’s were bringing out a new biscuit which comes with thousands of pounds’ worth of advertising and it’s going to be called the Ace biscuit. I said, ‘I love that name!’</p><p>“I sold out completely but paid for it straight away because they didn’t tell me the strap line was, ‘Ace, the incredibly thick chocolate biscuit’.</p><p>“On National Dunking Day, dressed in my Lycra pants, I had to get into a giant tea cup filled with foam in Leicester Square with Kathy Lloyd, the Sun <a href=#>Page 3 girl</a>.”</p><p>Being a Gladiator meant Warren was out partying most nights with fans who idolised him.</p><p>He says: “I was living my life like Schwarzenegger’s ethic — you only get one life, live it rich, live it fast.</p><p>“But nobody had taught me that the more you get of something, the less it satisfies you.</p><p>“I didn’t realise I was acquiring a destructive habit, <a href=#>drinking</a> too much, fornicating, having excess of anything I wanted.</p><p>“Morally, I was making some poor choices. When everyone is calling you Ace you start to believe it. I started to become conceited.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/802463b9-9aa7-4f7a-9bfc-9d55e941c628.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ngnjordan5-tif-JS1242897.jpg><p>In 1997 he got engaged to Katie Price, then going by her model name Jordan, and during their fiery relationship of nearly two years they both sold stories about their <a href=#>sex life</a>.</p><p>They finally split up after he accused her of sleeping with the then <a href=#>Formula 1</a> driver Ralf Schumacher, brother of <a href=#>Michael</a>.</p><p>Warren later said he had been in “a club of people who had had a lucky escape by not marrying Katie”, now a mum of five.</p><p>He now deeply regrets his actions and says: “It was selfish, It’s not the way I think now. I have great admiration for her. I know how difficult it is being a parent.</p><p>“If I see a picture of her in the papers and magazines, I pray that she would know God as I do and realise that her identity doesn’t have to be in altering her body or having operations. God loves who she is.”</p><p>He adds: “At the time we were playing games and selling stories about each other.</p><p>“Recently I sent a message to her parents to say, ‘I just want you to know I am sorry for my part in it. I hope you will forgive me’.</p><p>“Her parents came back and said, ‘We really enjoyed having you around’. It was quite heart-warming.”</p><p>The first version of Gladiators ran for 13 series before ending in 2000 after 133 episodes — but no one told its stars it was being axed.</p><p>Warren says: “I read it on the front of <a href=#>The Sun</a>. I was at a petrol station and The Sun had a picture of me and a thumb going down.</p><p>“Instead of the show’s catch-phrase, ‘Gladiators, are you ready?’ the headline said, ‘Gladiators, you are deady’. I picked the paper up to learn the show had been axed.</p><p>“My next call was to my bank manager, because take away the pugil stick and the Lycra, and I had no skills to pay the bills.</p><p>“I started going with my brother to work on roofs and people would be shouting abuse up on the scaffold — ‘Ooh, Ace, have you bedded Ulrika?’ It was humiliating.”</p><p>In 2000 he met Dionne, a Virgin Airways cabin crew manager and also a <a href=#>Christian</a>.</p><p>They now have two children — Bailey, 20, and Anna, 18. While Dionne flew the world, Warren worked as a building site manager.</p><p>He felt something was missing from his life and in 2015 he found what he was searching for on a Church of England course.</p><p>It led him to set up a <a href=#>charity</a>, Ace Active, which tours schools to spread the word.</p><p>On school visits he wears a costume made for <a href=#>Russell Crowe in the movie Gladiator</a> — which he bought for £60 on Gumtree — to explain how the Romans helped to create the Christian church.</p><p>Warren says: “Russell Crowe sold his suit for £60,000 so I got a bargain, as it is identical.”</p><p>Lockdown meant Warren could not visit schools and Dee’s flights were grounded, so they both decided to train to be vicars.</p><p>On July 6 they will be ordained, then sent to different churches to work.</p><p>Next Saturday Warren will sit down with his family to watch the new Gladiators and marvel at how the original series changed his life.</p><p>He says “I’ve seen clips and it looks fantastic. I’ll be shouting at the telly cheering the new Gladiators.</p><p>“I may even get back to the gym. Dee said to me, ‘You have got to get back into shape’, but I say, ‘Round is a shape, my dear’.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“I used to run the eliminator in the show’s Battle Of The Giants.
