Just keep watching and you will see the truth come out,” Eason wrote.</p><p>“I hope everyone is happy with themselves thinking such horrible things about me over the years. The difference between the truth and what you’ve heard about me is astronomical.</p><p>“I’m happy with playing the bad guy or taking the fall for my family. It’s a whole other story when major news outlets tell complete lies in order to smear my name,” he continued.</p><p>“The money they gain from using my name will never do them any good, its money made in vain from pure lie and deceit, it’s Satan’s work, its evil but it doesn’t scare me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1128284887-752x1024.jpg><p>Eason concluded with a plug for <a href=#>his debut hip-hop single</a>, which he released last month.</p><p>“Oh yea and don’t forget to download my song everywhere, follow me on spotify and Pandora or whatever you listen to, link in bio!” he wrote.</p><p>David received support from his fans, but quite a few commenters were critical of what they viewed as wildly insensitive response to a very serious situation.</p><p>“Using your stepson’s situation to get views on your ‘song’…” one user wrote.</p><p>“This is what happens when you’re a ‘public figure’ and you act like a fool for the whole world to see.
