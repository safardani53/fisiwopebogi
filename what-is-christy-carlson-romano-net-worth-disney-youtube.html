Money didn’t have a purpose for me, I didn’t really know what it was. I just knew that I had it and didn’t care about it.”</p><p>Following her Disney Channel days, Romano reveled that she ended up taking roles in “movies [she] didn’t want to do” just to make ends meet.</p><p>“Basically, I did a nude scene,” she recalled. “I had never thought in a million years that I would ever do something like this. I was America’s sweetheart, morally sound in my mind. I believed in the Disney magic, I still do. And then I felt so exploited and marked and horrible.”</p><p>While many reports online say that Romano has an estimated net worth of $3 million, she set the record straight and revealed she's by no means a millionaire but is "OK now."</p><p>“I am not a millionaire in any way, shape or form, I’m just a mom monetizing my channel, doing sponsored content, having fun, working when I can."</p><p>It is unknown what her exact net worth is today.</p><p>While Romano seems to have slowed down her acting career, these days she focuses on her nostalgic YouTube channel where she features other television stars, including Halloweentown's Kimberly J. Brown, <a href=#>Full House's</a> Jodie Sweetin and Lizzie McGuire's Lalaine.</p><h2>Was Christy Carlson Romano bullied as a child?</h2><p>Romano has recently been using her YouTube channel to talk about her Disney days.</p><p>Alongside her video "How I Lost All My Money," she did one about, <a href=#>"Why I Don't Talk To Shia LaBeouf,"</a> and "The Truth About The Disney Channel."</p><p>On August 31, 2021, Romano uploaded her most recent video in the series titled, "What My Celebrity Bullies Taught Me," where she opened up about "trauma" she received as a child star.</p><p>"I got bullied by a lot of kids. Some of them were famous," the former Disney Channel star revealed. "In fact, one of my biggest bullies is a really huge star. Kind of weird to see them...doing huge franchise movies."</p><p>While she never revealed the name of this "huge star," the Cadet Kelly actress went on to say that she has been "seeking closure" from her childhood bullies.</p><p>"I think, ultimately, it's because I really want to be accepted," she continued, before adding, "But you're not gonna get that closure from most people in life. You have to bring it to yourself. And that really sucks, especially when it comes to bullying. Especially when it comes to the trauma you have to live with on a daily basis."</p><p>While Romano has been dealing with the "trauma," she revealed that she's been able to put herself in a different mindset.</p><p>"I like myself, so I don't really care as much about what everyone else is thinking," she said, before concluding her video.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000676602179.jpg><h2>Is Christy Carlson Romano married?</h2><p>While Romano's Disney days are behind her, outside of YouTubing, she also went on to get married and start a family.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more from celebrity net worths</h2></p><p>In 2013, Romano married Brendan Rooney, who is known as a film producer and aspiring television cook.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Prior to a career in entertainment, Rooney served in the Marine Corps from 2001-2005.</p><p>The couple went on to have two children together, Isabella, 4, and Sophia, 2.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrZW19cn6RaK6hmaRitrR5wqGpoqukrnqkrdGlqqimXae8rq3NqGSnnaRixLC%2B06FknaGjo7K6ediorK2tkpp8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
