One name says it all after you’ve seen the viral video that has spread so quickly and caused so much controversy in the last 48 hours.</p><p>That is the name of the woman whose BRUTAL close-fisted, sneak attack sucker punch of an unsuspecting victim first surfaced on Instagram.</p><p>The beating has since been taken down from the social media site, but Sharkeisha’s shark-like attack lives on, as all things do in the Internet Age.</p><p>You can watch it here, but be forewarned: It is extremely violent …</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Tuesday night, the video of Sharkeisha’s personal <a href=#>knockout game</a> amassed 20,000 “favorites” in a matter of minutes, which is when it was taken down.</p><p>The original video was only a few seconds long and depicted Sharkeisha walloping the victim, whose name appears to be Shay, but that’s about it.</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span><p>The extended version (shown above) shows the infamous punch, Sharkeisha wailing on her some more, and bystanders finally intervening to pull her off Shay.</p><p>Sharkeisha continues to verbally attack the girl while she is held back.</p><p>It’s not yet known what the girl did to deserve the vicious pummeling.</p><p>Thursday, it was rumored that Sharkeisha was arrested for the cowardly assault and her alleged mug shot (above) began to circulate on Twitter.</p><p>This booking photo, tweeted by @desusnice, purports to be Sharkeisha Tyeshia Thompson, who may or may not be the puncher in the infamous video.</p><p>Either way, this sucker punching is getting out of control. All violence is bad, obviously, but if you feel you have to duke it out, at least engage head-on.</p><p>Even <a href=#>Jenelle Evans</a> follows that cardinal rule …</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Sharkeisha’s beating victim, Sharmichael Manuel, 17, told KHOU-TV she was astounded when her former friend mauled her in such fashion.</p><p>The Houston teenager says the assailant and a group of girls set her up for the fight video, luring her to an apartment complex under false pretenses.</p><p>Manuel thought she was picking up some of her belongings. She was wrong.</p><p>“I was just in shock. I was like oh my God. Did she really do this? You’re supposed to be my close friend,” Manuel said. “We were talking in school earlier that day.”</p><p>“She made it seem like there was nothing wrong with her.”</p><p>The fight broke out over a boy, Manuel reveals, and after Sharkeisha finished the staggering assault, a neighbor drove the battered teen home.</p><p>Manuel was left with black eye and busted lip. She hasn’t returned to school since the assault, in part because she has trouble seeing out of her eye.</p><p>“It is hurting and crushing to me,” Manuel said, noting that the physical pain is just the start. “I felt humiliated, embarrassed and hurt at the same time.”</p><p>Watch her talk about the ordeal below …</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>According to reports, the mug shot above of Sharkeisha Tyesha Thompson is of a 22-year-old North Carolina woman, not the teen in question.</p><p>Sharkeisha (or Sharkeysha, according to some Texas news sources) is a minor, and currently a student at Houston’s Cypress Creek high school.</p><p>Various Twitter and Facebook accounts have surfaced claiming to be the teen but none have been confirmed. She seems to be keeping a low profile.</p><p>Meanwhile, an impostor posed as the victim of the video on Twitter over the weekend and threatened to harm herself due to the excessive bullying.</p><p>As is the case with the purported Sharkeisha Twitter accounts, this is a hoax. The actual victim is seen above, with her mother, in the video interview.</p><p>The video continues its immense popularity nationwide, which says a great deal about web users’ love for violence, raw videos and unusual names.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2prX2Z%2BcL%2FHmqmknZmotaJ51aKbnqddqMKkt8SrZKmtnpi1br%2FHqJqkq12jrrW1zqdkoJ2kqHq6rc2knJ1llqe8rnnIp6po</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
