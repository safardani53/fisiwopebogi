The singer sat next to Travis’ mom, <strong>Donna Kelce</strong>, and was seen walking through the stadium with Travis after the game.</p><p>Since then, Swift’s attendance at Chiefs games has been a major point of discussion within the NFL. Travis <a href=#>weighed in on the league’s attention</a> during an October episode of his “New Heights” podcast.</p><p>“I think it’s fun when they show who was at the game. I think it brings a little bit more to the atmosphere, brings a little bit more to what you’re watching,” he said. “But at the same time, I think … they’re overdoing it a little bit, for sure, especially my situation. [But] I think they’re just trying to have fun with it.”</p><p>Travis took a turn in the stands over the weekend when he attended Swift’s Saturday, November 11, Eras Tour concert in Buenos Aires. During the performance, he was seen chatting with Taylor’s dad, <strong>Scott Swift</strong>, who was <a href=#>wearing a Chiefs lanyard</a>.</p><p>“Got him over to the good side, baby,” Travis joked during Wednesday’s episode of his podcast, telling Jason, 36, that he’s converting the Swifts “one by one” to join the Chiefs fandom.</p><p>In response, Jason appealed to Scott, 71, directly. “You’re gonna let this man’s devilishly good looks and relationship with your daughter sway you from a lifetime of fandom, Scott? Ridiculous.” he quipped.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Travis added that Scott is a “huge football guy” who played the sport in college. “I think he was a linebacker turned center,” he said. “He’s a tall guy.”</p><p>Monday’s Chiefs vs. Eagles game is a rematch of the 2023 Super Bowl, which earned Travis his second championship ring. Q102’s temporary boycott of Swift’s discography will begin at 5 p.m. ET on Friday, November 17, and end on Tuesday, November 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKehoZyhxm6%2BwJ2gqGWjqa61tc6nZJuZnqh6ta3YpaarZaOstqfAjJucn6eimnqmrcalnKxlpqh6pLTInp2sZZeWuqZ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
