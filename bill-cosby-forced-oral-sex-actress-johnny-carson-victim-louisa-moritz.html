It will do you good in so many ways.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>According to Louisa, Bill allegedly threatened as he was leaving&nbsp;the room, “Now you don’t want to upset me and the plans for your future, do you?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Like all of the claims made by&nbsp;Bill’s alleged victims, the statute of limitations on Lousia’s alleged assault has already passed, but she tells TMZ that she’s still planning to file a civil suit.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Bill’s lawyer,<strong> Marty Singer</strong>, tells the site, “We’ve reached a point of absurdity. The stories are getting more ridiculous. Mortiz is a lawyer who was disciplined by the California State Bar and ordered not to practice.” TMZ reports that they’ve seen the documents and that Louisa can’t practice law because she “didn’t report certain quarterly reports.” It’s unclear what the reports in question are about.</p><h3>Bill Cosby: Lou Ferrigno’s Wife Carla Accuses Star Of Sexual Assault</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Louisa’s allegations on Nov. 20 come on the heels of fresh ones from <strong>Lou Ferrigno</strong>‘s wife,&nbsp;<strong>Carla Ferrigno</strong>, who claimed on&nbsp;Nov. 19 that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bill had sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager</a>&nbsp;at a party in 1967.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Carla made the allegations during&nbsp;an interview on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>John and Ken Show</a>, claiming&nbsp;that Bill forcibly tried to kiss her, even though his wife was at the party.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Carla considers herself “lucky” compared to Bill’s other alleged victims, because the incident ended there.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, we know this is a lot to unpack what do you think about all of the sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby?
