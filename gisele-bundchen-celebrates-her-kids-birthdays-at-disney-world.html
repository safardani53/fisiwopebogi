I am so proud of you in every way. Thank you for making my life so much brighter!” Bündchen wrote in a message dedicated to Vivian.</p><p>In a separate post to Benjamin, she wrote, “Happy birthday to the sweetest boy! You have the biggest heart and I feel so lucky I get to learn with you everyday.”</p><p>Brady called his daughter “the sweetest little angel” in an Instagram upload of his own, adding, “Watching you grow into the amazing person you are brings me so much joy. You are always a bright star to all of us. Keep shining girlie girl, and never stop being the special, unique person you are. I Love you to the moon and back!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gisele-Bundchen-celebrates-her-son-and-daughters-birthdays-at-Disney-World-2.jpg><p>For Benjamin’s birthday, the retired NFL star posted a photo of his son in his football uniform. He wrote, “My son Benny, can you believe it? Fourteen years old already! It seems like yesterday you were running around in your superhero cape, and now you’re definitely a superhero to me. You’ve grown so much, and not just in height. You’ve grown in kindness, smarts, and all-around awesomeness. Your ability to make people laugh, your knack for solving problems, and your endless debating skills make you a force to be reckoned with. We love you so much.”</p><p>Bündchen and Brady <a href=#>finalized their divorce</a> in October 2022 after 13 years of marriage. Despite their breakup, the pair have continued to make their children a priority.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Tom and Gisele have navigated their coparenting relationship really well,” a <a href=#>source exclusively told Us Weekly </a>this month. “They have made a focused effort on putting their kids’ needs first despite things having not worked out for their marriage. Their children spend equal amounts of time with both parents which works out great all around.”</p><p>The insider added that the exes “have very healthy communication between them” and “are able to discuss their children’s needs in a really mature way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGagoaOauaZ5wa6lnZuYmrtur8SlnJuqkamytHnHnqlmo5mZwG6uyKuroZyRrsBurdNmm6KrnprGbsPOq6OdZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
