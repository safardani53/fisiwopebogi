The NASCAR legend was reportedly stabbed in the chest while filling up his gas tank. He was transported to a nearby hospital, where he died from his injuries. No arrests have been made by police.&nbsp;The 37-year-old racer was reportedly assaulted by a highly tattooed homeless guy identified as Trent William Millsap by authorities.
