But Episode 10, things go south and viewers see all of the cracks in the relationship. In Episode 11, Marshall and Jackie split up for good, with Jackie’s declaration that she plans to keep the engagement ring.</p><p>She also moves on with fellow Season 4 cast member <a href=#>Josh</a>, which makes the breakup all the more difficult for Marshall. But who is Marshall dating now, after Love Is Blind? He feels a connection with Jackie right away and he focuses most of his attention on her in the pods. So when he proposes and she says yes, it all falls into place for him.</p><p>Unfortunately, things go south pretty quickly. But the season was filmed a while ago and time might have healed all wounds for him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Marshall dating now after ‘Love Is Blind’?</h2><p>Marshall offered an update on his dating life at the Love Is Blind reunion: He is currently single.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a>, he said that <a href=#>he briefly dated fellow contestant Kacia</a> but that the two are not together. "We tried,” he said, “But I wanted to just distance myself from all of that — from that experience. It was going to be difficult to try to make a relationship with Kacia.” Marshall confirmed that he and Kacia had a brief thing on the reunion but that nothing long-term came from it.</p><p>For what it’s worth, Marshall’s outlook on his experience seems to be pretty positive. In March 2023, he shared an Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> with a photo of himself and the other guys from Season 4.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @marshallglaze</a><p>Marshall, Kwame, JP, and Paul bonded during ‘Love Is Blind.’</p></figure><p>“This group of men, brought together under the wildest of circumstances, showed true grit, determination, and commitment to finding 'The One,'” he wrote. “Oh yeah, we had some fun along the way.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Marshall is related to someone from ‘The Bachelorette.’</h2><p>Although Love Is Blind is Marshall’s first taste of reality TV personally, he is related to someone who Bachelor fans may already know. Justin Glaze from Season 17 of The Bachelorette is actually Marshall’s cousin. It’s unclear if Justin gave Marshall any pointers when he learned he would be on a different reality dating show, but the two of them are close.</p><p>When Marshall Facetimed his cousin during a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> video, Justin had nothing but positive things to say about his “hopeless romantic” fellow reality star.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Marshall Glaze (@marshallglaze)</a></p></figure><p>“This man has been writing sonnets since the moment that he came out the womb,” Justin said in the video. “We would all be playing sports, and what was Marshall doing?
