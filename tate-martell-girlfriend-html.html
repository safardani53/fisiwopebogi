In another tweet, Tafi reported that her son had not talked to her for weeks. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Tate Martell and Kiki Passo Are Not Together</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>As of now,&nbsp;Martell and Passo don't seem to be together. And all the pictures of them together have also been deleted&nbsp;from their respective&nbsp;Instagram handles.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Moreover, the model has been spotted&nbsp;sharing intimate moments with tennis player Tommy Paul on social media, hinting she has&nbsp;moved on from her relationship with the 23-year-old footballer.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In an Instagram post, posted in January 2021, Passo put her arms around&nbsp;Paul as she kissed him on his cheeks. Another picture from the same post had&nbsp;Paul kissing her as she sat on his lap <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Regarding&nbsp;Martell, he hasn't been spotted with any woman of late. His Instagram posts suggest that he has been putting more effort into his training and his game than anything else.</p><p>An <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram video</a> showed him speaking&nbsp;his aspiration to become the person everyone wants him to be—that includes his family, friends, city, and team.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>The Twitter Riot</h2><p>On November 28, 2019, a couple of days before&nbsp;Martell announced his unavailability for&nbsp;the University of Miami,&nbsp;Martell's mother <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a>&nbsp;that Passo was a&nbsp;horrible person.&nbsp;Tafi again took to Twitter on&nbsp;December 3, asking&nbsp;for anybody to have her son contact his family since&nbsp;the football player hadn't spoken to his family. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After&nbsp;Tafi posted those details on social media, various outlets and Martell's fans started tagging&nbsp;Passo and speculated she could be the reason for his disappearance. One fan <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a>, "Really sad if this young woman is encouraging him to miss football. He worked for this opportunity all his life. Praying it is all resolved for the best."</p><p>Passo quickly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a> to that fan's tweet. She explained that all the ongoing speculations weren't true, and instead, she pushed him to keep going when Martell had lost his job previously. He also emphasized that she "wholeheartedly" believed in him and saw a&nbsp;bright future ahead of him.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>hi there! i appreciate you asking me directly but i’m not going to bring my personal life into social media, there’s no need for that. the only thing i will say is that i have never told tate to quit football or kept him from anyone. — kiki passo â™¡ (@kiikipasso) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">December 4, 2019</a></p><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;Busted Coverage, a sports and entertainment magazine, added a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">thread</a> to the model's tweet and asked to clear the air of their split. The outlet tweeted, "Kiki, is there a beef between you & Mrs. Martell?
