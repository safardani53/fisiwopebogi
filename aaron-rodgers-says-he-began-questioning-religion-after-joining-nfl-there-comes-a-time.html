That happened to me six or seven years ago.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite growing up in Northern California with devout Christian parents, the 2011 Super Bowl champion said he regularly pressed clergy members on issues he had with the religion, and was often left unsatisfied with the responses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I remember asking a question as a young person about somebody in a remote rainforest,” Rodgers recalled to ESPN in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>the wide-ranging interview</a>. “Because the words that I got were: ‘If you don’t confess your sins, then you’re going to hell.’ And I said, ‘What about the people who don’t have a Bible readily accessible?’ ”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Aaron Rodgers.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Harry How/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rodgers’ questioning continued from his time in college at the University of California, Berkeley, to being drafted by the Packers in 2005.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When he took over as starting quarterback of the Packers in 2008, Rodgers struck up a friendship with pastor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rob Bell</a>. Their friendship did not primarily focus on Christianity, as the two shared interests in art and science as well, Rodgers told ESPN.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But, as the pair had conversations about religion, Rodgers said he realized over time he no longer felt a connection with the beliefs he was taught as a child. Instead, he said, he found more comfort in spirituality and no longer identified with a specific religion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The Bible opens with a poem,” Rodgers said of believing the Bible has become misunderstood. “It’s a beautiful piece of work, but it was never meant to be interpreted as I think some churches do.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During Patrick’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Pretty Intense podcast</a> in December, Rodgers said he<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2> felt the “binary” characteristics of religion can be a “crutch” for believers</a> — something he touched upon in 2017.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think organized religion can have a mind-debilitating effect,” he told ESPN, “because there is an exclusivity that can shut you out from being open to the world, to people, and energy, and love and acceptance.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Patrick also discussed her views on religion in 2018, stating she believed God was “not a dude on a throne in the clouds. It’s so much more than that.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m not necessarily of any religion,” Patrick, 37, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told podcaster Lewis Howes.</a> “I don’t believe in all of any of them. They all have good points. I could go to any religious ceremony and say that I learned something today, or I might dismiss it all. I’m not sure.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In response to Rodgers’ recent comments, a source tells PEOPLE that his estranged family felt like he had “turned his back on them.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There’s clearly a lot more to it, but that’s how he is perceived by his family,” the source close to the family added. “His comments are very hurtful to the family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6OlvLPA0miYmqqfo3qzu8OgnKurXaiuur%2BMoZxmmpWcrq950K6crKyZpLuqusZmqZ6kmZy2sLqMmp2tnaJit7C1zaKloGWem7luwMeeqZ5lk6S6pr%2BMmmStoZ2afA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
