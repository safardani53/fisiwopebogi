I feel like I just need more time," he told Mal, who did a pretty solid job of hiding any shock or dismay she might have been feeling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Toward the end of the episode, Perez and Zapata sat together at the scene of their almost-wedding and discussed their future.</p><p>They left things pretty up in the air, with Sal saying he needed "some time" but then asking Mallory on a date.</p><p>She accepted, but her pride had to be a little wounded.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Filming for LiB Season 2 wrapped over the summer, and many viewers are now wondering if Mal and Sal are still together all these months later.</p><p>But it seems like we’ll have to wait at least one more day for a definitive answer to that question.</p><p>Sal gave an interview to Us Weekly recently, but since the LiB reunion show won’t drop until Friday, he was limited in how much he was able to give away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I was a roller coaster of emotions [at the wedding],” <a href=#>Sal said</a>.</p><p>“I was just feeling everything, and I really was trying to wrap my head around everything that we had been through together.”</p><p>Perez went on to confirm that he didn’t know what he was gonna say at the altar until the moment it came out of his mouth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I was really just kind of summarizing it in my head and I knew that at that moment of my wedding, I just wanted to make that choice with her," he told the magazine.</p><p>"I wanted to see how I felt in that moment with her. It was a crazy day.”</p><p>In the end, Sal decided that he and Mal just hadn’t put their bond to the test enough to know if they would be able to weather the inevitable storms that come with any longterm relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I wish I would’ve, maybe, [had] those raw, emotional arguments a little bit more with Mallory,” he explained.</p><p>“I feel like those are key to our story and I just think that, maybe, a little bit more of that would’ve been nice.”</p><p>We’re sure all will be revealed when the on Friday’s reunion show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The most common prediction is that Mal and Sal have parted ways, and it seems that lots of folks are now shipping Sal and Deepti.</p><p>We doubt those are an item now, but crazier things have happened.</p><p>And that would be one hell of a happy ending!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WAcL%2FApa2anJ%2BnerGx0Z6xZpmemXqurculpquxXa%2Busa3TmmSaqpViwamxjKWmr51dnsBursuipZ1lo6mus7%2BMrKto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
