Now, they invite someone to sing "O Canada" because Buffalo is adjacent to the Canadian border, and many Sabres fans hail from Canada.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Doug Allen sang both the Canadian and U.S. national anthems at most Sabres home games before resigning in 2021 because he refused to get the COVID-19 vaccine. According to a September 2021 report by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Buffalo News</a>, Doug announced his departure in a letter to Sabres fans and told them he wasn't "anti-vaccine."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>(the sabres always do the canadian anthem guys)</p>— Alex (@bigbadbruins73) <a href=#>November 15, 2023</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"There are many people at risk who should get it. But, I am old enough to understand the importance of choice and the freedom of being an American," Doug wrote. "I had Covid in January of 2021. I now have natural immunity, so I am choosing to not get vaccinated."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A singer once forgot the lyrics to "O Canada" and was forced to improvise.</h2><p>Ahead of Buffalo's game against the Bruins on Nov. 14, 2023, Sabres singer Christian Kramer mixed up the lyrics of "O Canada" and completely skipped one of the lines. As a result, Christian was forced to come up with something on the spot — and it was so painful to watch.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>For those unfamiliar with the lyrics, Christian skipped the line "from far and wide" and went right into, "O Canada, we stand on guard for thee." He quickly realized his mistake, but it was too late. Nevertheless, the singer kept going and even came up with his own lyrics, singing, "O Canada, we stand our eyes, we stand on guard for thee."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Christian eventually got back on track, but his mistake was already noted by more than half the people in the arena, including a father-son duo who looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p>As expected, several viewers took to social media and joked about the singer's error — but we honestly feel bad for him. It takes a lot of courage to get up there and sing in front of thousands, so we don't blame him for getting a little nervous and forgetting the lyrics. All that matters is that he kept his cool and managed to get through the rest of the anthem without messing up!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOoZK2glWKvtrLFmqOoZaOWr7Ox0maqoqaXYsGpsYycmKeZlJ6ur3nAp6uhnZ0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
