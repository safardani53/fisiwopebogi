Look at it this way, the money you save on fuel and tax in a year could be a down payment on a holiday in Ibiza.</p><p>We decided to put the Ecomotive to the test by driving it around the island to find out just how far you can go on a tank.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more motors</h2></p><p>But with a range of 735 miles on a full tank Ibiza was simply not big enough — after two days of driving, the needle barely budged from full.</p><p>Which was good news because I worked out that the money I’d saved was more than enough to buy me several extra pints, even at Ibiza prices.</p><p>I’d like to say that the Ecomotive was as good to drive as it was to look at but the 1.4litre three-cylinder turbo-diesel is clearly built for economy and not performance.</p><p>Changes to the engine management system mean it’s all about maximising fuel economy, a point underlined by 0-62mph in a leisurely 12.7 seconds, but in laid-back Ibiza the lack of power didn’t seem to matter.</p><p>There are other fuel-saving measures, too. It’s more aerodynamic than the standard Ibiza and, because the grille is sealed off to improve efficiency, you get lips in front of the wheel arches to further reduce drag.</p><p>The air pressure in the tyres has been increased, there’s a sporty but functional roof spoiler and even the profiled door mirrors do their bit to help the aerodynamics. It is also 77lb lighter than the standard car.</p><p>And the Ibiza is well equipped with electric front windows, height and reach-adjustable steering wheel, folding rear bench seat, rev counter, three cup holders, air con, six-speaker MP3 compatible radio/CD player, ABS brakes and speed-sensitive steering.</p><p>Last but not least, this wallet and eco-friendly supermini doesn’t come with a big premium — the price is a very reasonable £11,995, which is another reason to celebrate.</p><p>Pictures: <b>JEREMY WILLIAMS</b></p><h2><strong>What to look out for when buying a used Seat Ibiza</strong></h2><p>While the electrics are generally dependable, the powered windows can take on a mind of their own, either refusing to budge or going up and down of their own accord. Annoying creaks and rattles can also crop up, while lots of wind noise from the front window seals can be an issue – especially on three-door models.</p><p>You may feel some weird clunks from the power steering, but these don’t mean anything is about to give up; it just seems to be a characteristic of some Ibizas. Also are stroppy stereos which refuse to talk to whatever MP3 player is plugged in.</p><p>A single recall shouldn’t give much cause for concern. It came in June 2012 and affected Ibizas built between April 2010 and November 2011. A faulty catch meant their bonnets could fly open, so be sure to check that that has been seen to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzgpFxbW5rX6yybr7Er6Cer12ptaZ50p6YrWWZl7a7rYyemqiln6m2t7GMn6mopV2lv6qvxGarqGWVmLyvu8yyZJqmlGKurbiMoqusZZaarrXB0Z6qaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
