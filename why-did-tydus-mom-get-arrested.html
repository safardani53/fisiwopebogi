Local news channel <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>KION 46</strong></a> also picked up the article to confirm her arrest, which took place after deputies were called around 10:18 p.m. Corey was reportedly drinking at a bar near a golf course to celebrate her birthday but allegedly became belligerent and was asked to return to her room in the hotel on the property.</p><p>When Corey reportedly refused to go back to her room, that's when she was arrested. The charges behind Corey's arrest are numerous and include "public intoxication, resisting arrest, pedestrian on the roadway, and battery on a peace officer." According to KION 46, when deputies attempted to escort Corey to her room, she was uncooperative and attempted to kick one of the officers.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>However, Corey has a different take on the encounter. Per TMZ, a source close to Corey says she was "celebrating her bday with her parents (her kid were not there) and alcohol was consumed. Corey did not resist arrest and was slammed to the floor in handcuffs without her Miranda Rights being read to her. Although this behavior is out of character for her, Corey strongly denies misconduct against a police officer and has retained legal counsel."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>A statement from Corey's attorney, Scott Erdbacher, obtained by TMZ, read "I am concerned about how much aggression was used against my client while she was handcuffed. My concern at this point is about Corey's well being and her injuries are currently being catalogued by a medical specialist including head to toe bruising, numbness and loss of mobility to her left arm."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Since her arrest, Corey has not commented on any potential legal trial or hearing regarding her arrest. Contrary to popular belief, Corey is not in jail and has continued to make content with her family as normal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2asqZnCtHnMqKRmn5WpeqK%2B0Z6qrZ2U</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
