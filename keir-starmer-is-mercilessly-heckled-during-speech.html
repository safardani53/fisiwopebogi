Hecklers included ex-Big Brother contestant Carole Vincent.</p><p>In the keynote speech:</p><ul><li>Sir Keir called Boris Johnson a "tool" and branded him "trivial"</li><li>He also urged the PM to "get a grip or get out of the way"</li><li>He pledged to give teenagers two weeks compulsory work experience</li><li>He pledged to make mental health services would be available within a month</li><li>Sir Keir unveiled a multi-billion climate policy to insulate 19million homes</li><li>Patriotism was a major theme running through the speech</li><li>Dame Louise Ellman received a standing ovation for rejoining the party after leaving because of anti-Semitism</li></ul><h2>JEER STARMER</h2><p>Exasperated Sir Keir was forced to stop speaking entirely at one point as he was drowned out by fired-up members.</p><p>Visibly frustrated he snapped back: "Shouting slogans or changing lives conference?"</p><p>One person howled out as Sir Keir spoke about his late mum Josephine's influence on his politics.</p><p>The Labour boss said: "I got from my mum an ethic of service. But my mum was also, unfortunately, a long-term patient of the NHS."</p><p>Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said it was "awful" hecklers piped up during such an emotional point.</p><p>At the end of the 90-minute speech his wife Victoria rushed up on stage to give him a massive hug.</p><p>Arch-heckler Ms Vincent - who finished fifth on series eight of big brother in 2007 - said afterwards: "I don't consider it to be heckling, I consider that I stood up and spoke out because it needed to be said."</p><p>She was upset with him vowing to raise the minimum wage by £10 rather than £15.</p><p>A spokesman for Sir Keir said Labour was "happy" with how the speech landed and that heckles were expected.</p><p>He said: "Obviously there was clearly a view that there could be those who would want to express an opinion in the speech."</p><h2>RESET MOMENT</h2><p>Allies view the speech as a major reset moment for Sir Keir's <a href=#>leadership </a>after a bruising 18 months in charge.</p><p>It's his first time speaking to the party faithful in person after Covid throttled his efforts to make an impression with voters.</p><p>He's also battled bitter infighting that flared again this week when a shadow cabinet minister resigned with an attack on Sir Keir for abandoning socialism.</p><p>Moves to change the party's rulebook to prevent another Jeremy Corbyn becoming leader also left Labour lefties reeling.</p><p>Yesterday Sir Keir declared that winning was more important than party unity.</p><h2>STARMER'S STALL</h2><p>Laying out his stall to the nation he said: "I see the government lost in the woods with two paths beckoning. One path leads back where we came from.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"None of the lessons of Covid are heeded. The divisions and flaws that were brutally exposed by the pandemic all worsen.<br>&nbsp;<br>"But there is another path down which we address the chronic problems revealed by Covid with the kindness and the togetherness that got us through.</p><p>"That path leads to a future in which a smart government enlists the brilliance of scientific invention to create an economy in which people are healthy and well-educated. A contribution society in which everyone has their role to play."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000683328248.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Keir Starmer slams govt's handling of fuel and HGV crisis in opening of Labour conference speech</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfpbyttdOimqxnYWt%2FeIOUbHBoo5Wev26%2F05qppp2iYra0ecyeqZyhnJrAtLjYZp%2Bem5uhsqV5w66poqaXYsCxscScn2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
