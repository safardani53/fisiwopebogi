It’s negligence.</p><h2>BANNED FROM KEEPING ANIMALS</h2><p class=mol-para-with-font>"It’s ill-treatment in that there hasn’t been any veterinary care for a dog that’s clearly emaciated."</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"Cassie was not receiving food," said Miss Taylor.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"Either the other dog was eating it or there was no food put down.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"The charge is failing to address the loss of weight rather than a deliberate act of cruelty.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"I can’t say that this is a deliberate case of failing to feed. Certainly, the dog was not sufficiently fed."</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The prosecution did not accept that the dog had an underlying condition because the couple seemed to have been advised by a vet in 2016 that follow-up appointments would be needed. Its weight then was only two stone 11 pounds.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>These appointments were never kept, however, and attempts by the veterinary surgery to make contact were unsuccessful.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A post-mortem suggested that there was no underlying reason for the weight loss.</p><p>This is a case of real neglect, not a deliberate attempt not to feed a dog.

It used to play around in the garden and the first time he realised there was a problem was when the dog collapsed.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in news</h2></p><p>Wray had owned the dog since it was a puppy but two years ago, its behaviour changed and it started jumping at shadows and running around obsessively.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>District judge Daniel Curtis told the couple: "Unfortunately, through your neglect, this dog had to be euthanised on the day that it appeared in front of a veterinary surgeon, who took the view, having examined it, that it was extremely malnourished and had been neglected.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"During that period, you did not do enough to save that dog. You should have looked after it. It’s an obligation that you have.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The dog was emaciated in 2016. It was even worse when you presented it at the vet’s in 2018."</p><p>Bloy was given 80 hours unpaid work and Wray was given five days rehabilitation. Both were ordered to pay £500 costs and an £85 victims’ surcharge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000480940029.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfbYVxfJRubGibn6q9rbGMn5iipJWZeqSty6Vkr52kqHqosdGmmKdlo52ysbTEq5to</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
