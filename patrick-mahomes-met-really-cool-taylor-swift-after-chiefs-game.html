(The Chiefs beat the Bears 43 to 10 with Kelce scoring during the third quarter.)</p><p>Kelce first planted the Swift seed in July after he attended her Eras Tour. At the time, Kelce shared that he was “a little butt-hurt” that he didn’t get to talk to Swift before or after her concert, hinting he wanted to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it.</p><p>Since then, the potential couple <a href=#>have “hung out twice,”</a> a source told Us Weekly exclusively on Wednesday. “Taylor and Travis met shortly after he tried giving her his phone number at her show earlier this summer,” the insider added.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After weeks of romance rumors between Swift and Kelce, the NFL game marked the first time they were seen publicly together. After the Chiefs win, Swift joined the NFL star at the post-game celebration hosted at Prime Social in Kansas City, Missouri. They<a href=#> even cozied up together</a>, per photos obtained by <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a>.</p><p>“I just thought it was awesome that everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her. The friends and family. She looked amazing … and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans. We script it all, ladies and gentleman,” Kelce added during Wednesday’s “New Heights” podcast episode. “It was absolutely electric.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapmaSntqS3jKaYoaedmsBuucStZKudkaG5unnCqKalZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqXqistOeqWabmJ6yp7%2BMoJimnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
