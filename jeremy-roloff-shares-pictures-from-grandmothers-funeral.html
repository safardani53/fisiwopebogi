Although heartbreaking, it was a celebration indeed.”</p><p>Concluded the podcast host, author and former Little People, Big World star:</p><p>She was a friend of Christ which turns the tables on the nature of a funeral.</p><p>Death does not have the last word for it was defeated long ago through Christ literally raising from the dead. I’m so thankful for that act of love.</p><p>An act that ushered in a new reality where I can say, “see you again grandma.” And know it to be true. “For Christians need never say goodbye!” – CS Lewis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>As you can see right here, Jeremy and his siblings — Jacob Roloff, Molly Roloff and Zach Roloff — were all present for the occasion.</p><p>So was Amy, of course, along with her fiance, Chris Marek.</p><p>Amy, for her part, has spoken eloquently about the loss of this parent.</p><p>“I am so sad about my mom’s passing but comforted by all the memories I have and that she lived a happy, long life with my father,” shesaid in an statement to People late last month, adding:</p><p>“She was a great mom.

She isn’t here anymore. I won’t be able to see and talk to her.</strong></p><p><strong>And yet she’s not in pain and hurting anymore either. She lived a good life with my Dad. She didn’t have to go in a home but was able to stay in her home until she died.</strong></p><p><strong>She would have been 87 years old and my parents would have been married 67 years on the 3rd. I’ll miss her a lot. I’ll miss not seeing her when I go back home – her strong feisty ways along with her gentle soft loving heart.</strong></p><p><strong>I’m thankful for so much because of my Mom. I’m thankful she believed and had faith and know she’s with Jesus now.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p><strong>I’m thankful I got to talk to her on Sunday before she went to the hospital and then passed away. I know she’ll never stop loving me and is proud of me, I’m thankful all my kids got to go to Michigan last summer and see her and my dad and she got to meet her great grand kids.</strong></p><p><strong>She was happy because of that.</strong></p><p><strong>I’m sad because I won’t be able to see and talk to her anymore and yet happy because she’s home with the Lord. I pray for my Dad.</strong></p><p><strong>He’s by himself and He misses her so much. He’ll be 91 soon and he lost his friend, his wife and the person he’s known for over 70 years and been married to for 67 years.</strong></p><p><strong>Even in my mom’s passing she is lovingly teaching and reminding me- life is but a moment. Be and do your best today and if tomorrow comes do it again.</strong></p><p><strong>Mom, I love you always.</strong></p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Jacob Roloff Wedding Day: See All the Beautiful Pics!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2Z9cLbEq5ymsV2nvK27xZ9krKCRp7K0ec%2Bimq2toprAbrLRqKRmn6KWu6W5zq2fnqqjYrO2usSrmKVn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
