She has been moving forward firmly as a mother, a loving wife, and an accomplished reporter.&nbsp;</p><p>Brooke met Josh through her mother’s friend during her tenure in Indiana in 2014. It was years after the death of her first husband, Andy Collins, when her mother’s friend wanted her to meet him.&nbsp;</p><p>At first, she had declined the offer; however, something stirred her wanting to go out and meet him. After their meeting, they exchanged emails and contact numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, they clicked with each other, and today, they have two beautiful children together. To elaborate, they have a son named Theo (born in 2015) and a daughter named Amara (born in 2018).&nbsp;</p><h3>Brooke Olzendam And Andy Collins</h3><p>Well, Brooke Olzendam met Andy Collins for the first time during his years in Southern California. Back then, she worked in television and often commuted to Portland to host the <strong>“Talkin’ Ball”</strong> show.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo dated each other not long after, and Collins was at the <strong>University of Oregon as a quarterback.</strong></p><p>Then, nearly a year after their relationship, the duo took vows in 2011. The two married in Seattle and later flew to live in <strong>Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</strong>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Brooke-is-married-to-Andy-Collins.jpg><p>Looking back, the duo met one night when they both happened to be at<strong> Nikki Beach</strong>, a bar in Venice. As a fun fact, they both had no intention to be out that day, but Brooke was out because of her friend who wanted to roam around L.A. while Andy was there to make sure his friend got a ride.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo saw each other for the first time and clicked instantly. Then, as they commenced talking and sharing their mutual interest in sports, they clicked and later shared a ride back to Andy’s home. Following it, they exchanged numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a matter of fact, the duo clicked and got together only after a few intense days. Hence, Andy Collins made a move and proposed to Brooke on Valentine’s Day in San Francisco.&nbsp;</p><p>Their wedding ceremony was organized in the presence of over 300 guests, but they didn’t have a proper honeymoon as Brooke had her work to accomplish.</p><p>However, the two had started their official honeymoon on one of the islands off the Florida Keys.&nbsp;</p><h4>Andy’s Sudden Death</h4><p>In August 2011, Brooke Olzendam and Andy Collins stayed at a hotel after returning from their House hunt. During that time, Andy was working out while Brook stayed in to iron the clothes.&nbsp;</p><p>After completing her ironing chore, she went downstairs to look for Andy after several failed calls.</p><p>Not long after it, she saw the Fire truck and paramedics rushing over for help, and when she couldn’t see him, she returned to the room.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, she got a call from one of the <strong>E.M.T.s,</strong> who stated that Andy had lost consciousness while on the treadmill. As she rushed in, a nurse tried to resuscitate him as the ambulance arrived.&nbsp;</p><p>Though no one said a word to her, Brooke felt a chill run down her spine as she figured out something was going wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>“Then there was a priest giving him his last rites. I just kept saying, ‘Please, come back.’ I was holding his hand when they said he was gone.”<br>-Brooke Olzendam</p><p>Altogether, they revealed that Andy Collins had a fatal heart attack. Even his autopsy report portrayed that Andy had arteries near his heart smaller than average, which was the root cause of his fatal death.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>You might also be interested in reading about Kristina Pink’s career journey and personal venture in life!&nbsp;</strong></a></p><h4>Funeral And Afterwards</h4><p>A week after the incident, they held the funeral in Andy’s hometown of<strong> Zillah, Washington</strong>. What was more heart-wrenching was that the duo was only married for ten days back then.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, this incident left Brooke Olzendam in despair, and she fell close to not returning to work. She stayed in bed for weeks and didn’t glance at her wedding pictures.&nbsp;</p><p>During that time, Brooke’s mother helped her to return all the wedding gifts. Almost after seventeen days of panic and breakdown, she returned to the field, and only this time, did she feel calm as she had never felt before.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Read more about Jane Skinner’s bio, career, family, net worth, and many more!&nbsp;</strong></a></p><h3>Brief Glance On Andy Collins</h3><p>Andy Collins was the<strong> three-time Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference offensive player of the year</strong> at Occidental College.
