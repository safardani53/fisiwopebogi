He was 49.</p><p>"It is with profound sadness that we share the news Christopher Hyndman died," CBC-TV said in a memo to staff. "We extend our deepest sympathies to Steven [Sabados], family, friends and colleagues; our thoughts are with them all."</p><p>According to CBC's report, Hyndman — co-host of the lifestyle show Steven and Chris — was found dead in an alleyway in Toronto's East End late Monday night. Fellow CBC personality Eli Glasner said the alley was near Hyndman's apartment, which he shared with his co-host and life partner Sabados.</p><p>Toronto police told CBC that the investigation into Hyndman's death is "completely open." No other details were provided, and Detective Terry Wray said there would be no further comment until interviews had been completed.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hyndman and Sabados had hosted Steven and Chris since 2008. CBC is currently weighing next steps for the program.</p><p>"I think about the loss for Steven, that his partner for 25 years is gone and that our friend is gone," executive director Jennifer Dettman shared on Tuesday. "And certainly for the CBC, he will leave a hole. He really touched so many Canadians across this country. We saw the emails day in and day out of what he meant to them."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewG602KebppmeYrGmrcNmmpubXZ28tMCMn6auppRitq95wKdkmqScmsZurdNma3JlYmV%2BdoGXaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
