She also wrote in the same tweet that he had lately been claiming he wasn't the father of her baby. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"[Rondo] spend more time chasing [expletive] than with his daughter (that he claim ain't his all of sudden), it just don't make sense to me. But it's been that tho," she&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a>&nbsp;in the tweet. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>In another tweet, she stated that people thought she was mad, but according to her, most of the things between her and Rondo happened "behind the scenes," and no one knew what the rapper was up to.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Due to that, she said many had a false image of her while adding she could reveal the whole truth about her ex-boyfriend with one picture. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"Ask him why I LEFT HIM ? Ion get left," she wrote in another tweet.</p><p>Likewise, Doll stated that she was also ready to sign the papers, implying she was prepared to get into legal trouble if she needed to do for the sake of her and her daughter's betterment.</p><p>But despite all the allegations of being an irresponsible parent and ex-partner, Rondo has made no comments on the matter so far. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Quando Rondo Recently Posted Pictures with His New Girlfriend</h2><p>Doll's bold statements against her ex-partner came a few hours after&nbsp;Rondo posted a series of pictures with his alleged new&nbsp;girlfriend, who goes by the username&nbsp;@kii.yaaah on Instagram.</p><p>In the snaps, the rapper and his new girlfriend were captured having some intimate moments. They were even seen kissing each other in the third picture of the slide.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Many of his followers immediately added that the girl looked young, possibly a high-school teenager. A few comments also revealed that the rapper had previously introduced the girl to&nbsp;his followers but as his sister. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I THOUGHT U SAID THATS YO SISTER," someone commented in his post.</p><h2>Jai Doll and Quando Rondo Welcomed Their Daughter in December 2019</h2><p>Doll and&nbsp;Rondo became parents when they welcomed their baby girl,&nbsp;Naomi, on December 8, 2019.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The young mother, who has over 204,000 followers on Instagram, has also documented her pregnancy journey on her Instagram highlights section. In the highlight titled 'Italy Naomi,' she has added pictures from the time she found out about her pregnancy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The highlight further features pictures and videos of her and Rondo celebrating Doll's&nbsp;pregnancy, <a href=# rel=follow>baby shower</a>, and the birth of&nbsp;Naomi.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>At present, the little one has her own <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram handle</a>, too, presumably managed by&nbsp;her mother, with over&nbsp;109,000 followers. But the handle only has 18 posts in the last two years.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKmllrulu4yrpqecn2K0qr7Ln6minZ6ZeqWt1KCfrZ2iY7W1ucs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
