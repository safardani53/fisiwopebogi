Celebrity Rehab producer <strong>Dr. Drew Pinsky</strong> — who advises the Teen Moms during the show's reunion specials — is also concerned about the MTV reality star, especially in the wake of her recent sex tape scandal.</p><p>"Farrah is making horrible, horrible choices," Pinsky said of the 21-year-old Abraham during a recent radio chat with Zach Sang and the Gang, when Sang mentioned that the Teen Mom alum had sold the tape to porn company Vivid. (Titled Farrah Superstar: Backdoor Teen Mom, the XXX-rated video is set to be released first on Vivid's website on May 6 and then in stores on May 14.)</p><p>"I have a relationship with her. I care about her. If she had called me for advice, I would have told her not to do this," he explained. "But she's not my patient, she's not my kid. I don't produce that show, I didn't cast her. I talked to her on a talk show — where I tried to talk some sense into her, mind you."</p><p>Pinsky noted that he had offered to further counsel the Teen Mom stars, to no avail. "I throw the net out there once in a while," he told Sang. "But I'm going to give them messages they don't want to hear."</p><p>Abraham, in particular, is unlikely to be receptive to his guidance, he said. "Let’s say she takes that $2 million and opens a restaurant, which has always been her dream — how are you going to talk a 21, 22-year-old out of that?" he asked. (In fact, TMZ reported that the single mother got closer to $1 million.) "I just don't know.”</p><p>Abraham, for her part, doesn't see what all the fuss is about. In a video defending her decision to sell the tape — which she initially said was made for her own personal use, but which adult film star <strong>James Deen</strong> described as a professionally shot porno — the MTV personality asked fans to put themselves in her position.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"On the real, what would you do?" she said. "You have been a single mother for four years, off and on dating loser-ass boys…and you've just realized you're an awesome person and you deserve someone, and now that you've been 21 and you've been crying every night because you're single and you're alone…you make your own video to celebrate your awesome body and get your own sexy shots."</p><p>"So the person you did this with has the urge to yell it out when he should be professional and not," Abraham (mom to 4-year-old Sophia) continued, referring to Deen. "So you have companies interested [in the tape]. Why not sell it?"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadql2Zv6bDjKmgp6ubrnqnrdGrmKFlkZe%2ForTApmSiq12irqy1zaBkoaeip7ajuMRmn6iqop6vrbGMnJ%2BooZOawG5%2Bj2pqbW1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
