The games at social casinos are all available to play totally free, with no purchase required. Since they are not considered a form of gambling, social casinos are very widely available - in almost every single state in the US - unlike real money casinos.</p><p>We‚Äôre going to get into exactly how it all works for poker right here in our Global Poker Casino review, including details on bonuses, payment methods, redeeming prizes, customer support, and much more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pros and cons of Global Poker</h2><p><strong><span><a aria-label="Global Poker (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Global Poker</a></span></strong> is almost unique as a way to play poker online. People from all over the US can play for free with the possibility of redeeming real cash prizes, even in states that don‚Äôt have legal online poker.&nbsp;</p><p>Below you can see our experts‚Äô favorite things about Global Poker, and where it could improve.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Lots of different types of poker&nbsp;</li><li>Ring games, Sit‚Äôn‚ÄôGos and multi-table tournaments all available</li><li>Slots and table games included too</li><li>Very widely available compared with traditional real money online poker rooms</li><li>Redeem prizes for as little as just 10 Sweeps Coins</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>No live chat support</li><li>No mobile app</li><li>No free SCs included with welcome bonus</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üí∞ Global Poker bonuses and promotions</h2><p>Like all social gaming sites and social casinos, a big part of <strong><a href=# aria-label="Global Poker (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"><span>Global Poker</span></a></strong> is the bonuses and promotions you can pick up along the way. In this section, we‚Äôre running through all the major promotions you can find at Global Poker.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Global Poker Welcome bonus</h3><p>Use the bonus code PLAYPOKER to unlock your <strong><span><a aria-label="Global Poker (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Global Poker</a></span></strong> welcome bonus, which actually has two components. First up, all you need to do is sign up and verify your identity and you‚Äôll find a supply of Gold Coins waiting in your account, ready to start playing. The standard welcome bonus offer is 100,000 GCs, but this can change over time.</p><p>The second part of the welcome bonus kicks in if you decide to purchase some extra Gold Coins. For one time only, you can get 150,000 Gold Coins for just $10, which comes with a bonus of 30 Sweeps Coins. A package like this would normally cost you $30, so it‚Äôs a good saving.</p><p>Alternatively, you can get 200,000 GCs plus 40 SCs for $20.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Global Poker code PLAYPOKER</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/thesun-global-poker-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Use code PLAYPOKER to get 150,000 GC for $10 + 30 FREE SC</p><p>18+ New players only, one-time promo code use on 1st purchase available in all states except WA, NV, ID.</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="SIGN UP (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Global Poker Purchase offers</h3><p>All the games at <strong><span><a href=# aria-label="Global Poker (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Global Poker</a></span></strong> are available to play with no purchase required, either in Gold Coins mode or Sweepstakes mode, and you can get free GCs and SCs in a variety of ways. However, you also have the option of purchasing additional Gold Coins if you run out of your free supply, or if you just want to top up your account.&nbsp;</p><p>If you do buy some GCs, you normally receive some Sweeps Coins as part of a free bonus. The Gold Coins packages range from $5 to $2,000. The exact packages and SC bonuses can change up over time, but you can click the ‚ÄúGet Coins‚Äù button to see what kind of offers are available.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Global Poker purchase offer</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/thesun-global-poker-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Find the Gold Coin bundle and play at Global Poker!</p><p>18+ Available in all US states except WA, NV, and ID.

Global Poker uses all of these methods to announce promotions and giveaways, and they‚Äôre a great way to keep up to date on the latest promos.</p><p>There is also the Global Poker login bonus, which can be claimed once per day and become progressively more valuable the longer you keep your login streak going. The offer starts at 1,000 GC + 0.25 SCs per day and grows from there.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üìã How to register at Global Poker</h2><p>Joining <strong><span><a href=# aria-label="Global Poker (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Global Poker</a></span></strong> is a breeze. You can choose whether to create an account using your existing Facebook or Google login details, or to sign up manually using your email address.</p><p>The former is faster but the latter is extremely straightforward too. All you need to get started is your email address and a password. Global Poker will send you an email to confirm your address, which you can click to continue the process.&nbsp;</p><p>This is enough to get your account set up initially, but in order to fully unlock your account and play in Sweepstakes mode, you‚Äôll need to verify your identity. This process takes a little time, but only needs to be completed once.&nbsp;</p><p>You‚Äôll find the Identity Verification option in your Account menu. You‚Äôll need to fill in the information and upload a copy of your ID, which will be reviewed by the Global Poker support team. As long as all your information is accurate, you‚Äôll have no trouble.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Global Poker code PLAYPOKER</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/thesun-global-poker-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Use code PLAYPOKER to get 150,000 GC for $10 + 30 FREE SC</p><p>18+ New players only, one-time promo code use on 1st purchase available in all states except WA, NV, ID.</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="SIGN UP (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üí≥ Global Poker banking methods</h2><p><strong><span><a href=# aria-label="Global Poker (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Global Poker</a></span></strong> has a solid selection of banking methods. Plenty of social casinos often allow you to make purchases with bank cards only, so it‚Äôs good to see some diversity here. The options available are below:</p><ul><li>Bank Cards (Visa / Mastercard / Discover)</li><li>Bank Transfer</li><li>Skrill&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We tested out all the methods during our Global Poker review, and the payment process was very smooth for each one.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to redeeming Sweeps Coins for cash prizes, which we‚Äôre going to get into in detail in the next section, Global Poker allows you to transfer the money to either your bank account or Skrill account - which is good.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üéÅ How to redeem cash prizes at Global Poker&nbsp;</h2><p>Explain what payment methods can be used, how long can it be processed, and what are the minimum and maximum cash prize amounts you can redeem at a time.&nbsp;</p><p>All of the games at <a href=#><strong><span>Global Poker</span></strong></a> can be played in two modes, using either Gold Coins or Sweeps Coins.</p><p>When you play in Gold Coin mode you are playing purely for fun. You can‚Äôt redeem any of your winnings for cash prizes and Gold Coins have no functionality at all outside of Global Poker. You can get GCs for free in lots of ways, and you purchase more if you run out of your free supply.</p><p>Sweeps Coins are somewhat similar, but with some differences. You can never purchase Sweeps Coins, only ever receive them as part of a free bonus.&nbsp; When you play in Sweepstakes mode (or promotional mode as it‚Äôs also called) you can redeem your winning Sweeps Coins for cash prizes at a rate of $1 for every Sweeps Coins.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember that you can only redeem Sweeps Coins that you have won. For example, if you purchase some Gold Coins and receive some free bonus Sweeps Coins, you won‚Äôt be able to withdraw your SCs without first using them to play games.&nbsp;</p><p>To redeem Sweeps Coins, you need to click the ‚ÄúGet Coins‚Äù button and then select ‚ÄúRedeem Prize‚Äù. Your SCs can be redeemed for a gift card or in cash that gets transferred directly to your bank account. You need a minimum of 50 SCs to request a cash redemption, but just 10 SCs is enough for a gift card - which gets sent to your email.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Global Poker code PLAYPOKER</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/thesun-global-poker-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Use code PLAYPOKER to get 150,000 GC for $10 + 30 FREE SC</p><p>18+ New players only, one-time promo code use on 1st purchase available in all states except WA, NV, ID.</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="SIGN UP (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üé≤ What games are available at Global Poker?</h2><p>The variety of games at <strong><span><a href=# aria-label="Global Poke (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Global Poke</a></span></strong>r is impressive. If you were expecting a site that just hosted straightforward Texas Hold‚Äôem ring games - and there are social poker sites out there that more or less do exclusively that - you have underestimated Global Poker. In this section we‚Äôre running through all the different ways to play.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>üÉèTypes of poker</h3><p>We were very pleasantly surprised with the range of different types of poker you can play. All of the following are available, in a variety of different types of tournaments and ring games:</p><ul><li>Texas Hold‚Äôem</li><li>Omaha</li><li>Omaha Hi/Lo</li><li>Bounty Poker</li><li>Jackpot Sit‚Äôn‚ÄôGo</li><li>Crazy Pineapple</li></ul><p>Put simply, this means there is something for every type of player. Want to stick to the basics that most people will be familiar with? Jump into a classic Texas hold‚Äôem ring game. More of a poker connoisseur? Test yourself with the strategy of Omaha or Omaha Hi/Lo. Short on time? Jackpot Sit‚Äôn‚ÄôGos with their turbo blinds are perfect.&nbsp;</p><p>It‚Äôs a great selection, for both beginners and more experienced poker fans.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Types of tables and games</h3><p>In addition to the poker variations, there are lots of different formats for how to play too:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Ring Games</strong> are similar to real money cash tables. You can simply sit down and play directly using your GCs or SCs, and you are free to leave whenever you want whether up or down.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sit‚Äôn‚ÄôGos</strong> are like mini tournaments with a limited number of people allowed. You buy-in for a predetermined amount (as low as just SC 0.25 in Sweepstakes mode) and keep playing until there is a winner, with prizes paid out depending on how many people there are. You can choose between a wide range of buy-ins and table sizes, including 2, 6, 9, 18 and 27 player sit‚Äôn‚Äôgos.</li><li><strong>Multi-Player Tournaments</strong> are larger tournaments. Rather than starting once a specific number of people have joined, these tournaments normally allow as many people as possible to sign up and start at a predetermined time. You can play MTTs with hundreds of people at Global Poker, including daily, weekly and monthly&nbsp; tournaments with guaranteed prize pools or money added.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This is an overview of the main formats but there are also all kinds of variations within these too. Overall, we‚Äôre very impressed.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-text-align-center>‚ô•<a href=#><strong><span>Get 150,000 GC for $10 + 30 FREE SC when you join Global Poker</span></strong></a>‚ô•</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>üé∞Global Poker slots and table games</h3><p>As if all that wasn‚Äôt enough, <strong><span><a aria-label="Global Poker (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Global Poker</a></span> </strong>also has a small selection of slots and table games you can play. While obviously not the platform‚Äôs speciality, it‚Äôs great to have the option and a nice change of pace from poker from time to time.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Global Poker code PLAYPOKER</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/thesun-global-poker-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Use code PLAYPOKER to get 150,000 GC for $10 + 30 FREE SC</p><p>18+ New players only, one-time promo code use on 1st purchase available in all states except WA, NV, ID.</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="SIGN UP (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üì± Global Poker mobile app</h2><p>There is no dedicated app for <strong><span><a href=# aria-label="Global Poker (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Global Poker</a></span></strong>. However, you can play Global Poker on mobile, both iOS and Android, by simply searching for the site using your device‚Äôs browser. You‚Äôll be able to log in or create an account, jump into the games, purchase coins or redeem prizes all right there on your phone.&nbsp;</p><p>The gameplay works well on the mobile screen, with a condensed version of the table and cards taking up more or less the entire screen. It doesn‚Äôt feel crowded and the action is smooth.&nbsp;</p><p>All that said, it would be nice to see a Global Poker app developed at some point.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Global Poker loyalty rewards</h2><p><strong><span><a href=# aria-label="Global Poker (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Global Poker</a></span></strong> doesn‚Äôt really have a loyalty rewards program, but it does have some kickbacks for returning players.</p><p>We‚Äôve already covered the various ways to get free coins, plus the regular giveaways hosted on Global Poker‚Äôs social media channels.</p><p>But regular players will also appreciate The Vault, which is a special offer designed by Global Poker to return some of the coins lost through the rake. It is in play on ring games only.&nbsp;</p><p>Every time some rake is removed from a qualifying hand that you play a part in, a fraction gets added to your Vault. You can head to your profile and find the ‚ÄúClaim‚Äù button to find out how many GCs or SCs are in your vault, and add them to regular balance again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>üìû Global Poker customer support</h2><p>The customer support at <strong><span><a href=# aria-label="Global Poker (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Global Poker</a></span></strong> is pretty good, but with room for improvement - chiefly via the addition of live chat support. At the moment, if you want to get in touch with the support team you need to do so via email, and wait for a response.</p><p>In fact, during our tests we received email responses pretty quickly to the questions we asked, but you just can‚Äôt beat live chat support in terms of convenience.&nbsp;</p><p>The help section at Global Poker is another story. There you can find tons of FAQs and articles explaining everything from the sweepstakes model to how the different types of poker work.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Global Poker code PLAYPOKER</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/thesun-global-poker-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Use code PLAYPOKER to get 150,000 GC for $10 + 30 FREE SC</p><p>18+ New players only, one-time promo code use on 1st purchase available in all states except WA, NV, ID.</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label="SIGN UP (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>ü§î Would we play at Global Poker social casino?</h2><p>Absolutely, and we especially recommend it if you live in a state that doesn‚Äôt allow legal online poker rooms.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span><a href=# aria-label="Global Poker (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Global Poker</a></span></strong> is a really impressive platform.
