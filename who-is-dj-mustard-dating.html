His birth name is Dijon Isaiah McFarlane and he is currently <strong>33 years old</strong>. People born on June 5 fall under the zodiac sign of Gemini. His zodiac animal is Horse.</p><p>Dijon McFarlane, professionally known as DJ Mustard, is an American record producer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record executive, DJ and hype man from Los Angeles, California. He is married to Chanel Dijon and is the father to 2 children, Kauner and Kylan. He is a frequent collaborator of Compton-bred rapper YG, and has produced numerous singles for hip hop and R&B artists since his entrance into mainstream music in 2011. Mustard’s production style has been described as an up-tempo, club oriented, catchy yet rudimentary melodic hip hop style. This style has snowballed into the contemporary production style of West Coast hip hop during the early 2010s, which he calls “ratchet music”. Almost all of his productions begin or end with the tag “Mustard on the beat, hoe!”, a voice sample of YG, who says it at the end of “I’m Good”, one of their early collaborations, as well as claps and repetition of the word “hey”. Mustard’s debut album, 10 Summers, was released on August 26, 2014.</p><p>His compilation album was released unofficially and was titled Let’s Jerk.</p><p>Continue to the next page to see DJ Mustard net worth, popularity trend, new videos and more.</p><p><strong>Last update:</strong> December 2023</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3ToqWgm5WhsqO%2FjZympmennbxutdJmm6NlnarAta3RnWSdmaSeu6h7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
