That night was funny,” says Jase, and his wife agrees. “But it wasn’t too bad, because I knew that he’d never done it either,” says Missy. “I wasn’t embarrassed. I wasn’t the only one having to learn. We look back and laugh now. We laughed that night too, like, ‘What are we doing? I don’t know. Let’s try this!'”</p><h3>Jase Robertson Admits That Sex Is A ‘Beautiful Thing’</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Three kids later, the couple has clearly figured it out!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Jase admits that he still makes moves on his lady, and they still seem like two teenagers in love! “I flirt with her.
