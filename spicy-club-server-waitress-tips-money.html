"This is the outfit!" Moe said, eagerly modeling her uniform.</p><p>She showed off the black tank top, matching short shorts, and fishnets, all accented by a waist-hugging belt bag.</p><p>Hours later, Moe checked in again. She sat on the floor in her own house, wearing a tracksuit and tank top.</p><p>"I just got home from my first night," Moe said. "It was a Tuesday, it was kind of slow, and I was f***ing nervous."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Lifestyle</h2></p><p>As she counted stacks of cash, Moe shared that her first evening at work was pretty uneventful.</p><p>"The only thing that bothered me was one mother****er who was trying to get me to 'do the do' with him for money," she revealed.</p><p>Moe said the "bold" proposal took her by surprise.

"That is $255," she said.</p><p>The newly-minted waitress was thrilled by her first night's income.</p><p>"This was life-changing," she said, grinning into the camera. "I can't wait for Friday and Saturday."</p><p>Her fans were excited to hear more.</p><p>"Can’t hardly wait for the stories," a viewer wrote. "They’re gonna be epic I can tell."</p><p>"So happy for you!" another fan said. "I did the same and honestly, I don’t regret it at all.
