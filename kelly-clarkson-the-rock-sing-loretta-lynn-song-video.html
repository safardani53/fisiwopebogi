Host <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kelly Clarkson</a> </strong>and <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson</a> </strong>celebrated the life and legacy of the late <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Loretta Lynn</a> </strong>with a version of “Don’t Come Home A Drinkin’ (With Lovin’ On Your Mind).” Loretta, who <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>passed away</a> on October 4 at age 90, had many great duets in her time, but this breakthrough hit wasn’t one – until now. Kelly, 40, and Dwayne, 50, each traded off lyrics before coming together for the final chorus. Kelly killed it, as expected, but &nbsp;The Rock did a pretty good job, as he infused his undeniable charisma into the performance.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Oddly enough, this isn’t the first time that The Rock has performed a Loretta Lynn song. In 2005’s Be Cool, he covered “You Ain’t Woman Enough (To Take My Man),” per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Country Music Nation</a>. Two years later, Johnson would cover <strong>Elvis Presley</strong>’s “Are You Lonesome Tonight?” for The Game Plan. That song also holds a place in The Rock Lore: he performed the Presley hit during his first time hosting Saturday Night Live in 2000. The then-WWE Superstar had help from two unlikely sources: <strong>Paul “The Big Show” Wight </strong>and <strong>Mick Foley, </strong>who came in as The Rock’s backup singers. And, of course, The Rock also sang “You’re Welcome” from Disney’s Moana.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Our precious mom, Loretta Lynn, passed away peacefully this morning, October 4th, in her sleep at home in her beloved ranch in Hurricane Mills,” the family of the country music legend said in a statement (h/<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>t AP News</a>). Loretta grew up in Butcher Holler as the daughter of a coal miner, which would become the title of her breakout hit in the 1960s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/the-rock-and-kelly-clarkson-duet-for-loretta-lynn-nbc-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Coal Miner’s Daughter,” “You Ain’t Woman Enough,” “The Pill,” “Don’t Come Home a Drinkin’ (With Lovin’ on Your Mind),” “Rated X” and “You’re Looking at Country” established Loretta as an honest voice in country music, one that would continue to inspire performers up until her death. She would duet with <strong>Conway Twitty, Willy Nelson, Elvis Costello, Tanya Tucker, </strong>and more.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Today is a sad day,” said <strong>Sissy Spacek </strong>in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>statement</a> following Loretta’s death. Sissy, 72, won the Oscar for Best Actress for her portrayal of Loretta in the 1980’s biopic Coal Miner’s Daughter. “The world lost a magnificent human being,” said Spacek. “Loretta Lynn was a great artist, a strong and resilient country music pioneer, and a precious friend. I am heartbroken. I send my deepest sympathies to her wonderful family, her friends, and her loyal fans.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BwZqSdnKHGbq%2FLmqmkq5%2BjerW0xGapqJubYsCqusZmo6iqlanBonnLsqWnZaOku6h51aKbnqdf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
