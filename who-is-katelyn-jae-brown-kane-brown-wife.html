However, Katelyn didn't leave music behind altogether; instead, she found herself better suited for the business side of the industry. She eventually went back to school and earned her undergraduate degree in 2019 from Berklee College of Music's Online Music Business program. "Finishing my education was the most rewarding thing I have done for myself thus far," she said in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>an Instagram post</a> celebrating her graduation.
