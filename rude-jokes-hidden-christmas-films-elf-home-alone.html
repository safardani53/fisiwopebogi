but have you ever noticed the cleverly hidden adult jokes buried in flicks made for kids?</strong></p><p>Like most years, many of us will opt for the same festive movie, but as we get older, some of us may start to <a href=#>uncover adult jokes</a> that have been hiding in them this whole time.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/shutterstock_editorial_5884647x-scjpg-JS698939794.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/JTEDBGjpg-JS625841224.jpg><p><a href=#>Dirty jokes are often carefully hidden</a> within the scripts of some of our favourite childhood films to keep the adults entertained.</p><p>And Christmas films, in particular, are buried with sexual innuendos, cheeky one-liners among the standard mix of gags.</p><p>On the face of it, they’re subtle and are intended to fly over a kid’s head, leaving parents either chuckling or red-faced.</p><p>Here, The Sun takes a look at five classic Christmas movies and the blatantly obvious dirty jokes buried in the squeaky clean worlds.</p><h3>Elf</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/BKCRPM_hp__6_jpg-JS694351381.webp><p>Taking the plunge to leave the North Pole in search of his biological father - who resides in New York - <a href=#>Buddy the Elf</a> reminds everyone he meets about the spirit of Christmas.</p><p>Despite the PG-rated holiday film being fun for the whole family, Elf fanatics will be more than aware that the flick features a certain sexual reference.&nbsp;</p><p>Children will, almost certainly, turn a blind eye when Miles Finch tells Buddy that he “gets more action in a week” than he does - but adults will be sure to understand the abrupt and honest meaning.</p><h3>Frozen</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Virus_Outbreak-Streaming_14755jpg-e3213jpg-JS571970240.jpg><p>Fans of Frozen will be more than aware that, during the first film, Anna gets engaged to Prince Hans.</p><p>When she then travels across the frozen forest with Kristoff to try and find missing Elsa, the iceman probes Anna about her future husband - whom she has only known for a few hours.&nbsp;</p><p>She goes on to say that his favourite food is sandwiches, his best friend’s name is “probably John” and his eye colour is “dreamy”.</p><p>When Kristoff then asks what his foot size is, Anna hits back: “Foot size doesn’t matter.”</p><p>While this may seem innocent to the children watching, many are convinced that it is a not so subtle joke about Hans’ manhood.</p><h3>Home Alone</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/aczac974jpg-JS688258065.jpg><p>If you're like a lot of people, watching <a href=#>Home Alone</a> might be on your annual to-do list every time the holiday season begins.&nbsp;</p><p>But, even and perhaps especially if you've been watching it since you were a kid, there are bound to be some things you ever noticed.</p><p>Once Kevin realises that he’s home alone, he pretty much does what every kid would do in that situation.&nbsp;</p><p>He jumps on his parent's bed, eats way too much junk food, and rummages through his older brother’s forbidden stash.&nbsp;</p><p>While he’s deep into that last one what does he find in Buzz’s stuff, a Playboy magazine, but after looking through it for a matter of seconds, he simply throws it out.&nbsp;</p><h3>Jingle All The Way</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SNY18DECS36Bjpg-JS698901432.jpg><p>In this festive flick, Arnold Schwarzenegger takes on the role of Howard, a desperate dad struggling to get hold of the most-wanted toy of the year.</p><p>But when he tries to speak to his wife, there's confusion as to what's keeping her from coming to the phone.</p><p>"Jamie, let me talk to your mother," demands Howard, before his son replies: "You can't - she's next door petting Ted."</p><p>Make of that what you will.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><h3>The Santa Clause</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/91f00520-1a6d-4154-b91a-7492fc856c81.jpg><p>When Scott Calvin -
