It was Christmas Day in 2012 and she was staying at his Los Angeles home when he told her he had to leave for a short moment. That’s when, just hours later, photos of Chris and Rihanna courtside at a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Los Angeles Lakers</a> game appeared online.</p><h3>Karrueche Tran: OWN Interview Is About Her ‘Mistakes’ — Dissing Chris&nbsp;Brown?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I knew. I didn’t want to believe it, I loved him,” Karrueche admitted to Vanzant believing that she was being two-timed by love rat Chris.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Indeed, the courtside photo that incensed Karrueche, certainly showed there was something going on between Rihanna and Chris. She was spotted resting her head on his shoulder, while the pair were all smiles as they watched the Lakers. It was very suspect even then!</p><h3>Chris Brown & Karrueche Tran: How Their Relationship Ended</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Chris’ tumultuous relationship with Karrueche came to an end after it was revealed he fathered a child with another woman. The R&B star cheated on Karrueche AGAIN, this time with model <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nia Amey</strong></a>, producing a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>9-month old girl</a>&nbsp;named&nbsp;<strong>Royalty</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Karrueche confirmed her relationship with Brown was over when she tweeted on March 4:&nbsp;“Listen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family. No baby drama for me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>What d’you think <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
