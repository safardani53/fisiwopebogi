Food guy, Adam Richman.&nbsp;</h2><p>First premiering in 2008 on the Travel Channel, trained sushi chef Adam Richman took on the role as host of Man v. Food. His love for food and relatable personality just oozed off the screen like a mouthwatering slice of grilled cheese. Basically, fans could not get enough of the show and we're still hungry for more.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the 45-year-old decided to forgo competitive eating and retired in 2012. “I am out of the food challenge game & while I love how that phenomenon has caught hold worldwide, and love hearing about your culinary conquests — I have ‘hung up my competitive fork’ so to speak,” the TV personality posted in a lengthy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Facebook statement</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Adding, “I now seek to explore, to learn, and to share what I've learned about food, places, people, and travel itself & make that information enjoyable and accessible to everyone.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After leaving Man v. Food, Adam didn’t stop hosting food-related series. He went on to star in Adam Richman’s Best Sandwich in America, Food Fighters, and more. Most recently, he hosted the series Man Finds Food (2014-2017), which introduced audiences to secret restaurants and hidden items on menus.&nbsp;</p><p>The Brooklyn native is still very much involved in the culinary world and recently appeared on the TODAY show as a celebrity chef, cooking up some Fourth of July steak.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is the host of Man v. Food in 2019?</h2><p>Following Adam’s departure from the hit series in 2012, the Travel Channel decided to reboot the show in 2017. Actor and foodie Casey Webb took on the role as host of Man v. Food. According to his bio, the professional eater was bartending in Brooklyn when he received the call that he was the new “Man.”&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“This is a dream job!
