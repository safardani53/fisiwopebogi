Like a tab of LSD,” Harry wrote. “I read somewhere that smell is our oldest sense, and that fitted with what I experienced in that moment, images rising from what felt like the most primal part of my brain.”</p><p>Harry revealed his other coping mechanisms, which included <a href=#>turning to psychedelics</a> and psilocybin mushrooms, during a 60 Minutes interview, which aired on Sunday, January 8.</p><p>“I would never recommend people to do this recreationally,” the BetterUp CIO told <a href=#><strong>Anderson Cooper</strong></a>. “But doing it with the right people if you are suffering from a huge amount of loss, grief, or trauma, then these things have a way of working as a medicine.”</p><p>For Harry, the drugs provided him with clarity and closure. “They cleared away this idea that I had in my head … that I needed to cry to prove to my mother that I missed her, when, in fact, what she wanted was for me to be happy,” he said.</p><p>The Duke of Sussex explained that he was “constantly trying to find a way to cry,” adding that he’d even watch videos of Diana to promote tears.</p><p>Harry was only 12 years old when Diana passed away. His brother, <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a>, was 15. Her death came just one year after she finalized her divorce from <a href=#><strong>King Charles III</strong></a>.</p><p>Harry and William, 40, have worked to keep Diana’s legacy alive through their charity work, activism and the lives of their children, specifically their daughters.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>William, and his wife, <a href=#><strong>Princess Kate</strong></a>, welcomed <a href=#>Princess Charlotte</a> in May 2015 and graced her with Diana as a middle name. Harry did the same in June 2021 when he and wife <a href=#><strong>Meghan Markle</strong></a> welcomed their baby girl, <a href=#>Lilibet</a>. The little one’s moniker is also a nod to <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, who died at age 96 in September 2022. William and Kate, 41, also honored Her Majesty as their second child’s full name is Charlotte Elizabeth Diana Mountbatten-Windsor.</p><p>The Sussexes are also parents to son <a href=#>Archie</a>, 3, and the Cambridges share sons <a href=#>Prince Louis</a>, 4, and <a href=#>Prince George</a>, 9.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6W%2FqrrCnqqsZZSerq%2Bt0mannqqWqrqmeceeo6mdlGK9s7XNnJxmoJGnv7p5z6umnJ2jqHqpsdFmm56ZpJ18</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
