But if you're getting to the bottom of the jar, don't get rid of it because there's actually a way to use every last bit of <a href=#>candle wax</a>.</p><p>In August 2023, <a href=#>TikTok</a> creator Sylvia (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@mssylvee</a>) shared a genius hack for how fellow Bath & Body Works customers can get every last ounce of candle wax from each jar ‚Äî and it involves boiling hot water.</p><p>Read on to learn more. Plus, stick around to hear what the internet has to say.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what is the hack for using every last bit of Bath & Body Works candle wax?</h2><p>In a text overlay of the video, Sylvia said she was going to use "every bit of these candles." With that said, she lined up three candles and poured boiling water over the remaining wax.</p><p>As a result, the hot water allowed the wax to rise to the top of the jar. Sylvia then removed the wax pieces, broke them up, and placed them under an electric wax warmer. For those unaware, this will melt the wax and release its scent into the air to welcome a deliciously warm aroma into a home.</p><p>"Use the jar to store [the wax pieces]," Sylvia wrote before the video ended.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@mssylvee href=#>@mssylvee</a><p>Don‚Äôt throw away those candles!! üïØÔ∏è</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - J.CABB" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - J.CABB</a></figure><p>The viral video, posted on Aug. 29, 2023, has more than 3.5 million views and over 1,300 comments from many fellow Bath & TikTokers and Body Works customers praising Sylvia's candle hack.</p><p>"[You] just changed my life," one person said in the comment section.</p><p>A second user wrote, "Taught me something, I be throwing them right out."</p><p>"I'll never throw another Bath & Body Works candle away in my life!!" another TikToker admitted.</p><p>A fourth person commented, "Very smart," while another penned, "I love you for this."</p><p>"I've literally been keeping them all trying to figure out what to do with the remains," someone else shared.</p><p>One user added, "I literally spent 25 mins trying to dig out the last of my fav candle to put in my [Scentsy], THEN I see this."
