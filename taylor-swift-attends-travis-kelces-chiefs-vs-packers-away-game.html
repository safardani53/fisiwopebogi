Swift arrived wearing black thigh-high boots over matching tights a black dress and a long red coat, per <a href=#>social media footage</a>. <strong>Brittany Mahomes</strong> was by her side as she entered the stadium.</p><p>Swift made her <a href=#>first appearance</a> in Kelce’s cheering section at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, in September. She attended three additional games during a hiatus from her Eras Tour in October, but a series of concerts in South America in November <a href=#>kept her from several more</a>. Sunday marked the first time she has been seen at a Chiefs game since the team won against the <a href=#>Los Angeles Chargers</a> on October 22.</p><p>Swift has been an avid supporter of Kelce since the couple were <a href=#>initially linked</a>, and he returned the favor on November 11 when he <a href=#>attended one of her shows</a> in Argentina. She notably gave him a shout-out from the stage when she <a href=#>changed the lyrics</a> to her song “Karma” to reference him, singing, “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.” The pair also <a href=#>shared their first public kiss</a> when they greeted each other backstage following the concert.</p><p>Swift wrapped up her 2023 tour dates in Brazil on November 26, and a source exclusively told Us Weekly that she <a href=#>jetted right to Kansas City</a> to spend time with Kelce, touching down on Monday, November 27. She now has two months off before <a href=#>her tour resumes</a> in Tokyo in February 2024.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Taylor-Swift-at-Chiefs-Packers-Game.jpg><p>As Kelce and Swift’s romance heats up, an insider shared in November that they “have <a href=#>very detailed plans</a>” to manage their busy schedules. “Taylor and Travis have the next few months completely laid out,” the source told Us. “They don’t want to start their relationship off with big gaps [in time spent apart]. They’re trying to be as much like a regular couple as possible.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A second source, meanwhile, revealed that <a href=#>Swift and Kelce are “in love”</a> and recently began dropping the L-word. A third insider confirmed that things are “getting very serious” between the two, adding, “Taylor sees long-term potential with Travis.”</p><p>Though Swift has remained tight-lipped about the relationship, Kelce gushed in November about her contacting him after he failed to give her a friendship bracelet at her Kansas City concert in July. “There were definitely people she knew that knew who I was, in her corner [who said]: ‘Yo! Did you know he was coming?’ I had somebody <a href=#>playing Cupid</a>,” he recalled to WSJ. Magazine. “She told me exactly what was going on and how I got lucky enough to get her to reach out.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdlsG1sc2dqmasopbDqr%2BMpJylm5WoeqS0yJ6drGWmqHqxrcKknKurXZbEosWMoJimnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
