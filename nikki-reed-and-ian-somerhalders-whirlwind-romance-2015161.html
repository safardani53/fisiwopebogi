The next step came just as quickly when the pair <a href=#>married in April 2015</a>.</p><p>“I still have no idea if we’re doing it right, but I know we both wake up every day and choose each other,” the <a href=#>Twilight</a> actress wrote via Instagram <a href=#>to celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary</a> in April 2019. “We’ve seen a lot, we’ve done a lot, we’ve laughed a lot, we’ve laughed a lot of it off, and we’ve continued to be each other’s biggest cheerleaders, and truest support system.”</p><p>Us Weekly <a href=#>confirmed the couple were dating</a> in 2014. In the years since, they’ve <a href=#>welcomed a daughter</a>, Bodhi Soleil, and <a href=#>a son in June 2023</a> — and they continue to share their love for each other every chance they get.</p><p>Before Bodhi was <a href=#>born in July 2017</a>, Somerhalder opened up about his <a href=#>desire to start a family with the Thirteen actress</a>.</p><p>“Oh, I will one day have amazing children with my beautiful wife.

You’ve taught me so much through your generosity and ability to love like no other.”</p><p>The Vampire Diaries alum told <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> in February 2021 that the <a href=#>key to making their relationship work is “communication”</a> during an appearance on SiriusXM’s Radio Andy.</p><p>“Taking time for yourself — for yourselves together [and separately],” he added.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After Cohen asked if he was a generous lover, he said “of course,” noting that sex is about “generosity and compassion and giving, you know, it’s all about sharing equal, it’s about sharing.”</p><p>Scroll to take a look back at the pair’s romance:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNku6q3yqJkq52VmXqiusNmoJqmXai8rrHRoZilnJWnwG7Dx6Kppa%2BZo7Fuvs6mmKeblWJ%2FcX2Uam1qZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
