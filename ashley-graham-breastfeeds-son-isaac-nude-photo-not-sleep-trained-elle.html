"I've got a couple of family members who are pregnant, and my instinct is to say, 'Oh, do this, do that,' " she tells Bell, 40. "But I stop myself every time, because I remember how I felt when everybody told me what to do <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>and sent me their unsolicited advice and</a> their lists."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If there's a question to be asked, ask it. But other than that, keep your trap shut and just let that mother figure it out. The mommy-shaming on social media is out of control," she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for how she approached <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>getting her son to snooze through the night</a>, Graham — who poses nude in one photo, while breastfeeding — says she "just kind of did what [she] wanted to do" and reveals Isaac "is not sleep-trained."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Ashley Graham, son Isaac and husband Justin Ervin for Elle.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Justin Ervin for Elle</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Ashley Graham for Elle.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Justin Ervin for Elle</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1><strong>RELATED GALLERY:</strong> 6 Products to Ensure a Good Night's Sleep for Baby, from PEOPLE's Health Squad Pediatrician</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"But he only wakes up maybe once or twice in the night, max," she says. "I feel 100 percent rested, so it's not like I'm living in agony every day <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>like, 'He didn't sleep last night.' "</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, Isaac is "screaming at the top of his lungs" nowadays and "thinks it's so fun to be louder than Mom and Dad," says his mama, adding, "I think we've figured out the diapers we like, and we only have maybe one blowout a week. And I'm still breastfeeding."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Graham also discusses with Bell (herself a mother of two) <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>how the pain of childbirth was much more intense</a> than she'd anticipated, admitting, "I had no idea it was going to hurt that bad."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Every mother talks about, 'Oh yeah, it's painful.' Whether they got an epidural or not, or a C-section, whatever happened, they're like, 'Yeah, it hurt.' And they say it kind of calmly like that," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They don't go into the astronomical pain that you go through, especially if you choose to go natural," adds Graham, who previously <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>opened up about her home birth story</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Elle's August 2020 cover.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gigi Hadid for Elle</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Ashley Graham Shows Her "Greatest Strength" in Powerful Photo from When She Was in Labor with Son</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The "silver lining" in the ongoing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>coronavirus pandemic</a>, Graham says, "is that I gave birth just before quarantine, so I’ve been able to watch Isaac grow up before my eyes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Experiencing every single moment with him has been a dream come true," she continues, admitting, "I feel really bad for the next kid, because I don't know if they're going to get this much attention."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Having a baby has also made the model appreciate what her body can do even more, even though there were some <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>mental hurdles she had to clear</a> along the way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I got pregnant, I had to re-imagine my relationship with my body with this creature inside me taking over. I was gaining weight so rapidly," Graham recalls. "Then, to get stretch marks on my stomach, that to me was like, 'Oh my gosh. I can't believe this happened.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She adds, "At first it felt devastating, and then when I met Isaac, I said, 'No, this is exactly what every woman has talked about for ages. This is not just a battle wound. This is something that has changed my life forever, and I'm <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>going to celebrate my new body</a>.'
