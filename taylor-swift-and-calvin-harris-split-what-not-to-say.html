It’s true. It’s just a true and sad fact. What’s different about a celebrity relationship, especially a <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taylor Swift</a> relationship, is that millions of people have something to say about it. In the case of Swift, what people “have to say” somehow manages to be both boring and offensive, focusing on Swift’s music and craft as somehow profiting from this, as if Swift is unique in being a musician who draws from personal experiences. (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>She’s not. She’s not. She’s not.</a>)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>via GIPHY</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That’s why the comments “<a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taylor Swift</a> has another ex to sing about!” or “<a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Taylor Swift</a> is already getting to work on her next album!” aren’t funny and they’re wrong. (Swift could write a banger about dirty shoelaces, and anyone who doesn’t recognize that is cloaked in willful ignorance.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I can write a song about making eye contact with someone,” Swift once said, low-key shading her haters. “I don’t need a relationship to have good material.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>via GIPHY</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, comments about Swift’s unoriginality as a songwriter – “she’s always writing songs about dudes who’ve wronged her!!” – minimizes her craft in a way that a male artists’ never would. So when a brand – that shall go unnamed – tweeted: “Silver lining for Swifties? New break-up songs!” they reduced the complexity of her work in a really boring, sexist way. Homegirl has earned 10 <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Grammy Awards</a>, 19 American Music Awards, 22 Billboard Music Awards and 1 Emmy, as well as been honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. And you’re seriously going to credit the not-so-nice guys she’s dated (and the perfectly nice guys with whom it just didn’t work out) with all her success? No. That will not stand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But don’t get us wrong: Swift writes excellent breakup songs. (We listened to “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” upwards of 47 times last night.) She has undoubtedly guided millions of people through breakups – with her music and by actually reaching out to heartbroken fans. In 2015, when a teenage fan was dumped by her boyfriend via text, Swift took the time to comment on the girl’s Tumblr post: “It’s so devastating to come to terms with speaking of someone in past tense when you used to see them as your present and your future. But think about what he said: It will take a while for you to get those words out of your head.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We hope that Swift finds the space she needs to process the breakup and tune out the obnoxious Internet chatter. And, if the next “Blank Space” comes out of all this – as artists have drawn inspiration from hardship for. thousands. of. years. – we will all be #blessed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Oauaau0aKrsmeklsatu9FmqrChlql6orrDZpqapKaeu260wKupoqtdqL2ttdNmrqGZpGK7sMCMraZmq5GufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
