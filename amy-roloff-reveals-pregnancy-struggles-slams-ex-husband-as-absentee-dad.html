Could I carry three?” she asked aloud during this Instagram session.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Amy did end up having twins — Jeremy, who is an average-sized adult; and Zach, who was born with dwarfism.</p><p>Amy told Dixon that her mindset, upon learning she was carrying a pair of babies at once, was the following:</p><p>“My body can do this,” “I can handle it,” and “I’m capable.”</p><p>After Roloff delivered the twin boys via C-section, she told Lisa that she felt alone, explaining that she and Matt had just moved to Oregon and she was “by herself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This is where Amy hurled a bit of shade in her ex-spouse’s direction.</p><p>The TLC personality confessed that “Matt had to go to work” and handing two newborns was “a lot to take on.”</p><p>She didn’t really elaborate in this Q&A, but Amy has taken the occasional opportunity over the years to say some negative things about Matt.</p><p>Most notably, <a href=#>Amy once accused Matt of cheating on her</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I think when you start looking before you’re separated in marriage, that is hard,” Amy said in a 2019 promotional interview for a book she wrote.</p><p>“When you become involved or much more than just a friend, but you become more in a relationship than just say ‘Hey, hi friend, lets go out for coffees’ type of thing, I think that can be hard on the other person as well.”</p><p>Amy did not mention Caryn Chandler by name at the time.</p><p>However, Chandler worked as a manager at Roloff Farms and clearly got close to Matt before the two started dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“We had someone that worked for us for a very long time, on our farm,” Amy added back then.</p><p>“And I believe – this is all from my perspective –&nbsp; that there was more than just friends going on.</p><p>“And I think that evolved to a point where that got in the way of our marriage as well.”</p><p>Amy got married to Chris Marek in August 2021, while, just a few weeks ago, <a href=#>Roloff and Chandler got engaged</a>.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WCcK3MsmSrp5yks6d50Z6tnpmcqHqxvsSgpZqmk656tMDRrp6gpJWoerS4wKaqZp2oYrW2v8GapZ1lkah6oq7SnqWtnZVisaKwjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
