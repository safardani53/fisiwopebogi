Remy reignited their 10-year-long feud last night during the 2017&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>MTV Video Music Awards</strong></a>, and her diss wasn’t subtle. The rapper took the mic with pre-show host, <strong>Terrence Jenkins</strong>, 35, to tease the night’s upcoming acts before a short commercial break. After Terrence J teased a performance by<strong> 30 Seconds To Mars</strong>, Remy said,&nbsp;“The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2017 MTV Video Music Awards</a> are back in 2 minutes.” Nothing wrong with that, right? With a few seconds left before the commercial break, Remy paused before she said, “Nicki, what’s good?” Oh, she went there. And, Nicki has yet to respond. [Watch, below!]</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Remy didn’t stutter one bit when she threw shade at her longtime nemesis, which had some fans thinking that she planned the moment ahead of time. She slightly smirked after the diss, while Terrence J threw some playful punches into the camera as he walked away. Although Remy only had the mic for about 15 seconds, she still managed to hash up their feud. And, some fans weren’t too happy. Since Nicki wasn’t scheduled to hit the stage until the very end of the show, some Twitter users pointed out that Remy’s diss wasn’t necessary, whatsoever. But, there were dedicated Remy fans who remained loyal to the “ShETHER” crooner. [See tweets, below!]</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>As you may know, Nicki and Remy haven’t been the best of friends throughout the years. Well, they haven’t been friends at all. Believe it or not, their feud actually stretches back to 2007. Nicki dropped her mixtape in 07′, titled, “Dirty Money”, where she targeted a female rapper, where she called said rapper a “b–ch,” along with a slew of other subtle slams. Remy eventually responded and it became a bit of a back and forth. However, when Nicki’s career flourished and Remy was hit with incarceration in 07′, things seemed to have died down. But, while Remy was away, she had a lot of time to think of some new rhymes for her enemy upon her release.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Fast forward to 2017, when Nicki dropped a song with <strong>Gucci Mane</strong>, 37, on Feb, 25, titled, “Make Love”. She didn’t name any names, but when Nicki spit, “Everybody know you jealous, b–ch it’s so clear / Tell them bum ass b–ches to play their role,” fans thought it was about Remy. So, Remy dropped a scathing track not long after, titled, “shETHER”. The track&nbsp;contained wild allegations, where she accused Nicki of getting butt injections, sleeping with&nbsp;<strong>Trey Songz</strong>,&nbsp;32, using&nbsp;a ghostwriter and more. The cover art even included a broken and bloody barbie with a pink wig; obviously a shot at Nicki.&nbsp;Just days later, Remy released&nbsp;ANOTHER diss track, on March 2. Nicki then fired back with some disses on her track with <strong>Drake</strong>, 30, “No Frauds” and you guys can see the pattern that went on.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/Damnathaneal/status/902001167038767106</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>After that, fans went wild with their thoughts on Twitter.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Did Remy Ma really just say "Nicki what's good"? she gotta keep bringing Nicki up to stay relevant I swear <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#VMAs</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/mtwUGoPCuN</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>— Friendly Black Hottie (@DesiiDear) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>August 28, 2017</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/brandonaf_/status/902009173260558337</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-11><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/StunnaTella/status/901990950968467457</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what did you think of Remy’s diss?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH15e5FxZqudna56rq2MnaCsq5Woeq%2B1wqSgZqWZo66reZFpaHBlpqKubrnTr2SvoZSavG651KygnGWRrK6zsNJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
