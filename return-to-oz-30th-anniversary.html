Although this sequel offered audiences plenty of fantasy, it didn’t shy away from the darker bits of Oz lore, and more than a few young viewers had trouble sleeping at night.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">(Yes, this writer was among those kids who were terrified.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This week, the movie turns 30, and enough time has passed for traumatized young viewers to see that Return to Oz stands in good company with other beloved ’80s kids movies that dared to be scary, such as The NeverEnding Story and The Dark Crystal. What better way to celebrate the anniversary with a look back at the scenes that made it dark, twisted and in the end, great?</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Dorothy goes to an insane asylum.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yep, that’s how the movie kicks off. Having returned to Kansas after the events of the first movie, Dorothy – played as both wide-eyed and courageous by a 10-year-old Fairuza Balk in her film debut – is sent to an asylum. Auntie Em (Piper Laurie) hopes that electroshock therapy will cure Dorothy of her delusions of Munchkins and witches.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A storm knocks out the power moments before Dorothy is scheduled to be zapped, but the scene is still full of dread and foreboding. That line by the head nurse (Jean Marsh) – “Would you like to go for a ride, Dorothy?” – before she gets strapped to the gurney is as creepy as anything spoken in a horror movie.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Dorothy almost drowns in a catastrophic storm.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Violent meteorological phenomena are both a blessing and a curse for Dorothy. Whereas a tornado took her to Oz in the first movie, torrential floodwaters take her there in Return to Oz. When a mysterious girl who helps Dorothy escape from the asylum seems to disappear in the floodwaters, viewers are left to wonder if she drowned.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This scene also introduces the film’s stand-in for Toto, Dorothy’s pet hen Billina, who may or may not be creepy, depending on your feelings about talking chickens.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Claymation monsters are horrifying.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What is it about Claymation that makes it so creepy? Even when the figures are cute, there’s an uncanniness to them, but the stop-motion villains in Return to Oz, the Nome King and his rock monster henchmen, are clearly meant to be scary.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Oz is basically post-apocalyptic.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kiss your childhood memories goodbye. Dorothy quickly discovers that the Yellow Brick Road has been dismantled, that the Emerald City is in ruins, and the Tin Man and Cowardly Lion have been turned to stone. Eep. And that’s not all</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Then there are the Wheelers.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They’re the goons residing in the ruins of the Emerald City, and never have roller skates been so scary. They’d be terrifying even if they weren’t actively trying to kill Dorothy, but it’s all the scarier when they make threats like “We’ll tear you into little pieces and throw you in the Deadly Desert.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>That scene where Princess Mombi removes her head.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dorothy seeks help from Princess Mombi (Jean Marsh, again), but this woman is no Glinda the Good Witch. A major tip-off for poor Dorothy happens when Mombi removes her head and replaces it when another that she keeps in a glass cabinet, in what has to be the creepiest dressing room in the history of film.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Oh, and all the spare heads are sentient – and mean.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Dorothy steals Mombi’s Powder of Life, she finds that the heads double as a security system. They all start screaming, and Mombi’s headless body rises up in a scene that’s reminiscent of the Italian horror classic Suspiria – and if you think that’s an odd reference to be making in an article about a children’s movie, you’re not wrong. It’s a very surreal, scary scene.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>There’s something unsettling about Jack Pumpkinhead.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Return to Oz‘s analogue for the Scarecrow is the aptly named Jack Pumpkinhead, whose head is hollow enough that Billina can hide inside. He’s a well-animated creation, but something about that face combined with his emotional hang-ups – he insists on calling Dorothy “Mom” – makes for a weird combo.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>And finally the Nome King.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A stop-motion masterpiece, the Nome King serves as the film’s big bad. And he and his underlings sure are creepy, but the final battle with him gets downright bizarre when he attempts to eat Jack, only to have Billina poop an egg right down his rocky gullet. The baddies immediately crumble, because it turns out that chicken eggs are poison to Nomes. Of course!</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>30 Years Later…</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps Return to Oz set Fairuza Balk on a dark path. Now 41, she’s continued to act ever since, often in dark roles, and perhaps her best-known role is the villainous witch Nancy in 1996’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Craft</a>. Balk also appeared in Almost Famous, American History X and The Water Boy. She is set to play a recurring role on the upcoming season of Ray Donovan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Piper Laurie, who played Auntie Em, is of course best known for playing the title character’s psychotic mother in Carrie, for which Laurie got one of her three Academy Award nominations. Laurie, 83, who has continued to work in movies and TV, also played resident sexpot Catherine Martell on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Twin Peaks</a>. (She’s down to return for the revival, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>this interview</a>.) In 2011, she published her autobiography, which detailed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>losing her virginity to Ronald Reagan</a> in 1950.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jean Marsh, 80, may be most familiar to American viewers for having played Princess Mombi (or her main head, anyway), but she also played the villainous Queen Bavmorda in the 1988 fantasy epic Willow. Marsh co-created and starred in the landmark British TV series Upstairs, Downstairs and reprised her role for the 2010 revival.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Celebs Reveal: My Favorite Scary Movie!</span></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52kw6qx0mipnqylp7tuwM5mprNlY2XBqXnAp6WirpWnwKK%2B2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
