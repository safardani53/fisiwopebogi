In the years since, he became a staple on the popular morning series. But he has also taken a few significant breaks from the show.</p><p>So, why is Michael Strahan not on Good Morning America lately? Here's what we know so far about the situation.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is Michael Strahan not on 'GMA'?</h2><p>Michael's most recent absence from GMA (his last appearance was Oct. 26, 2023) — as well as his recent absence from his football commentating gig on <a href=#>Fox NFL Sunday</a> (he last appeared on Oct. 22, 2023) — have been due to a family issue.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Michael Strahan will not be with us this week as he is dealing with some personal family matters,” an ABC spokesperson told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a> in its Nov. 6, 2023 report. “We appreciate everyone’s thoughts and concerns.”</p><p>And during the Nov. 5, 2023 broadcast of Fox NFL Sunday, commentator Curt Menefee told the audience that Michael was “dealing with a personal family matter."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In the past, Michael's absences have been typically explained by his many other projects, both on television and beyond. Indeed, Michael not only works on GMA and <a href=#>Fox NFL Sunday</a> (which film on opposite coasts), but he also hosts $The 100,000 Pyramid. The busy multihyphenate has own skincare line as well, in addition to a well-known apparel line.

Michael has a lot of irons in the fire, from his production company (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>SMAC Entertainment</strong></a>) to his duties as an NFL announcer, but he seems to be a cracker jack at time management.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"People say, 'When do you sleep? Why do you work so much? You do Fox. You do GMA. You do The $100,000 Pyramid.' I love it though," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> back when his skincare line launched. "And I'm now at the point of where I don't have to do anything I don't enjoy. And if it gets to the point where I don't, then it'll be time to let that [thing] go. For now, every bit of it is fun."</p><p>We certainly hope that all is well for Michael and his family, and that he returns to our screens soon!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZKahk52upriMrKurmZiWu266zq1kqKZdnLqi</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
