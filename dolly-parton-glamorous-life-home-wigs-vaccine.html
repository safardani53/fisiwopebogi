That was almost a pleasure - to get peed on - because it was so cold."</p><p>The family also reportedly had to offer the doctor that delivered her a bag of oatmeal as payment, as it was all they could afford.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/60e5b9d6-c2c0-4105-a4df-ea34af79ad0c.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000618161001.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fcae206b-833e-4d0e-ae01-a2b2209ed8a8.jpg><p>Dolly later set up a literary program, the Imagination Library, which gifts books to kids who may struggle to access them otherwise, as a tribute to her father who couldn't read and write.</p><p>She told The Sun: “I’m very proud of it. I established it in my home county because my dad couldn’t read or write. He lived long enough to see it start and I got him involved.</p><p>“He was so smart, so wonderful and such a good daddy but it was just crippling to him that he couldn’t read.”</p><h2>The rise of Dollywood and endless philanthropy work</h2><p>The program is one part of Dolly's Dollywood Foundation, which she set up in 1988 -

However, she tends to go au natural at home behind closed doors.</p><p>She told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elle magazine </a>in 2019: "I don’t always wear [wigs] in my daily life, but I always still pouf up my hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000618161105.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000633066461.jpg><p>"I still like to have that flashy hair. When I’m around home, I wear my little scrunchies, but I always put on some makeup and fix my own hair as cute as I can fix it."</p><p>Dolly added that she chose to opt for wigs in public in the end due to the ease of them, and added: "Wigs are just so handy. I’m so busy, and I have so many choices. I never have a bad hair day, and that’s a good thing.”</p><p>The star has also posed in endless fashion and magazine shoots over the years, including an iconic one for Playboy in 1978.</p><p>In October she revealed she was in talks to model for the mag once again - but insisted the sexy photos "will be in good taste".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000618161063.jpg><h2>Covid 'saviour' with huge donation & bedtime stories for kids</h2><p>Dolly's latest effort, however, has once again cemented her as a legend in the spotlight - after she donated the huge $1million towards the Moderna vaccine efforts.</p><p>And it's not the only thing she's done throughout the pandemic to help people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000575863769.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000615600050.jpg><p>The singer has also been reading bedtime stories to children virtually in a 10-week series called, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Goodnight With Dolly</a>.</p><p>Away from her foundation, the singer herself has helped countless charities over the years - including the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, Cancer Research UK and the Boot Campaign, which supports veterans and military families.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Elsewhere, Dolly has been a strong advocate of the LGBTQ community and even hosts an annual 'Gay Day' at Dollywood for her fans.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In August last year, she also threw her support behind the Black Lives Matter movement, telling <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard</a>: "Do we think our little white asses are the only ones that matter?
