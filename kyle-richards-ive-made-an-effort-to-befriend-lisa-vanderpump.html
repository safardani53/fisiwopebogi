Emails and text messages and, you know, I don’t know what else to do,” Richards, 49, told Us at Rachel Zoe’s Holiday/Resort 2019 collection presentation in Palisades, California, on Wednesday, November 28 about trying to get back in Vanderpumps’ good graces.</p><p>She continued: “As far as I’m concerned, the ball is in her court … I don’t want to get myself in trouble here.”</p><p>As for the recent Vanderpump Dogs Foundation gala event, in which Richards and the other castmates of the Bravo show did not attend, the Little House on the Prairie alum explained that she “wasn’t invited.”</p><p>Richards elaborated: “The other years I was invited, I received an invitation.
