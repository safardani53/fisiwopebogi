Jessica Dube</h3><p>What comes to your mind when you hear ice skating? Of course, most of us think about athletes gliding across an ice surface with elegance and giving an incredible performance.</p><p>But the accident faced by former Canadian figure skater Jessica Dube in 2007 reminded everyone how dangerous the sport could be.</p><p>In 2007, at the Four Continents Championships held in Colorado Springs, Dube’s partner Bryce Davison came too close during the free skate segment. The incident occurred on their third rotation side-by-side camel spin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jessica-Dube-injury-denverpost.webp><p>Davison had come too close during the spin, and his skating blade struck Dube in the face. Immediately she fell to the ice, and the audience gasped when they saw Dube clutching her face as blood pooled on the ice.</p><p>Medical staff immediately took her off the ice and rushed her to the hospital. She had to undergo surgery and received stitches.</p><p>Luckily her eyes were not affected, and nothing was broken. But both Dube and her partner had to undergo PTSD after the incident.</p><h3>8. Bryce Florie</h3><p>Bryce Florie is a former MLB pitcher and is number 8 on our list for a worst sports injury. In his career in MLB that spanned for eight seasons, Florie is remembered vividly for the facial injury he suffered in 2000.</p><p>In 2000, Florie pitched for the Boston Red Sox against Ryan Thompson of New York Yankees. He was hit on the face by a line drive off the bat of Thompson.</p><p>The next thing Florie knew was that he was lying on the ground and bleeding. The impact fractured his cheekbone and orbital socket. Similarly, he also suffered damage to his eye retina.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bryce-Florie-Bostonglobe.jpg><p>After the injury, Florie has to undergo surgery to relieve the pressure caused by the injury and save his eye. In 2001, he returned to MLB but was released by the team.</p><p>Florie never played in major leagues again. One can say that the injury cost him his MLB career. The fractured bones had healed, but the injury’s impact on his vision continues to date.</p><h3>7. Bobby Valentine</h3><p>On our number 7 of the worst sports injury is former professional baseball player Bobby Valentine. He was one of the top baseball prospects in the late 1960s. The Los Angeles Dodgers drafted him as the fifth overall in the 1968 MLB draft.</p><p>The incident occurred in 1973 when Valentine was 23 years old. His leg drove into the vinyl between two support poles in an outfield chain-link as he attempted to steal a home run.</p><p>Valentine was down on the ground, and his shin was bent in the middle. As a result, both his lower right leg’s bones were fractured. After the injury, he spent nearly six months recovering and was put in two different casts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bobby-Valentine-breaks-his-leg-Thisdayinbaseball.webp><p>However, Valentine’s bone healed poorly. The doctors discovered the bones had knit poorly. Despite the injury not healing properly, he returned to play the following season.</p><p>As one can imagine, the poor healing hampered Valentine’s career. Although he did his best and did not quit the sport, who knows what achievements he could have achieved had he not suffered the injury!</p><p><a href=#>Which sports do you think are the top 10 most dangerous sports?

Oupa Buti Ngulube</h3><p>The next injury that we will mention on our list is that of a soccer player Oupa Buti Ngulube.

The injury cut his career short. He could not return to the field after the gruesome attack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Oupa-Ngulube-injured-Soccerladuma.jpg><p>For Ngulube, it was his childhood dream to play soccer. However, his career was cut short after the incident without even playing in the top-tier league.</p><p>The most heart-wrenching thing is he had gone to work as a waste collecter after his career ended. So his injury is not only one of the worst but the most unfortunate one in sports history.</p><p><a href=#>Go through 5 Nike Deadlift Shoes To Hit Gym!</a></p><h3>5.

Unfortunately, he also had to undergo second surgery after a couple of months.</p><h3>4. Zach Miller</h3><p>Football is one of those sports where players get into injuries.

Norton was pinned underneath for a couple of minutes under him due to the injury.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Napoleon-McCallum-Sportscasting.jpg><p>The injury was so severe that McCallum suffered a ruptured artery in his left knee, tore three ligaments, tore the calf and hamstring from the bone, and suffered nerve damage in the knee.</p><p>The surgeon compared his injury with that of a car accident. Moreover, the injury could have led to his leg amputation, but luckily the surgery went well. Unfortunately, McCallum’s career ended after the injury.</p><h3>2.
