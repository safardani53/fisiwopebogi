The pair rose to prominence in the 1990s because of their incredible rhythms, muscular guitars, and “a combination that nevertheless sounded sinewy on ballads.” The best-selling pair split in the late 2000s but reunited for a live performance in the 2010s before reuniting in 2019 with Reboot, a compilation of re-recordings of the two’s classics as duets with contemporary country musicians.</p><h2>Kelsea Ballerini</h2><p>The country singer-songwriter was the first female country artist to earn three consecutive #1 songs from her first album. The next New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash vocalist began composing songs at the age of 13 and went to Nashville to pursue a musical career at the age of 15. By the age of 20, she had acquired a publishing agreement with Black River Publishing and a recording contract with Black River Entertainment.&nbsp;In 2015, she released her debut full-length album, The First Time, which quickly hit number four on Billboard’s country charts and number 31 on the Billboard Top 200.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/New-Years-Eve-Live-Nashvilles-Big-Bash-2.jpg alt="New Year's Eve Live Nashville's Big Bash" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>The Zac Brown Band</h2><p>Zac Brown’s multi-platinum, Grammy-winning “southern rock ground” includes six albums that have been in the top ten of the Billboard 200. The trio has won three Grammys, including Best New Artist in 2010, sold over 30 million singles and 9 million albums, and has sold over 10 billion catalog items.
