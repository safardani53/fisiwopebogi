The popular program follows the lives of seven women who either work in the medical sector or have spouses who do. As the women balance their lives and negotiate personal and professional relationships, viewers are offered enough drama. Heavenly’s intervention this week did not go well, as seen by her battle with Contessa. Heavenly departed Contessa’s home and had an emotional outburst as a result of her intervention.</p><p>Heavenly’s YouTube channel material caused a disagreement among the Married to Medicine women. Contessa, Toya, and Simone prepared an intervention for Heavenly about the material in which she disclosed facts about other women’s personal lives in order to obtain more followers on her social network account.&nbsp;Meanwhile, supporters were divided on the subject. While some thought Heavenly only revealed things that were public, some thought that revealing Contessa’s marital problems on her channel wasn’t the best idea.</p><h2>In the most recent episode of Married to Medicine, what occurred between Heavenly and Contessa?</h2><p>Contessa and Heavenly clashed over Heavenly’s account of Contessa being unhappy about her marital problems. This resulted in an argument between the two, in which Heavenly was chastised for having an opinion on a marriage that had lasted over 15 years. With the argument just becoming more heated this week, more drama is predicted in the next episodes.&nbsp;Contessa, Simone, and Toya’s intervention for Heavenly didn’t go well on this week’s episode of Married to Medicine. Heavenly felt deceived and wounded when she was accused of exploiting her YouTube channel to discuss the women’s personal concerns in order to obtain more followers and subscribers.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Contessa-1.jpg alt=Contessa width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>While the women were preparing a presentation for the intervention, Heavenly merely chuckled at all the problems, which irritated Contessa. Contessa expected Heavenly to feel sorry for speaking publicly about the women, but when she didn’t, Contessa was quite upset.&nbsp;When Jackie went to speak to Heavenly, she told her that Contessa’s concern should be with her husband, not with her. She just did it since everything was already out in the open. Heavenly went on to explain that she and Contessa would never be able to overcome their differences and become friends.</p><h2>Fans had mixed feelings regarding Heavenly and Contessa’s feud.</h2><p>Heavenly and Contessa’s quarrel divided fans. Many people considered that Contessa should be humiliated by her husband’s behavior, not Heavenly’s since the latter had simply talked about what was previously known. Some, on the other hand, chastised Heavenly for gossiping about Contessa’s personal life.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Heavenly embarrassed you Contessa?

Miss Gomez was extremely close to the family and cared for the children as if they were her own. The reality star spoke up about parenting her children with her mother and reflecting on her own childhood.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Contessa-2.jpg alt=Contessa width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Simone and Cecil had a Halloween party, which sparked a dispute between the two guys.
