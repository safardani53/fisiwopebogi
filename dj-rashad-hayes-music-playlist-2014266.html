When it comes to picking the right tracks to keep a party going, look no further than <strong>DJ Rashad Hayes</strong>. Hailing from Brooklyn, N.Y., he's spun at parties for <strong><a href=#>Jay Z</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Drake</a></strong>, among other A-list hosts. With summer well under way, <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> asked Hayes to share his hottest summer jams. &nbsp;</p><p>"Down On My Luck" by <strong>Vic Mensa</strong>: "My pick for one of the songs of the summer. Just a sublime and incredibly melodic song. I dare anyone to listen and not have it in your head for the rest of the day."</p><p>"Your Style" by <strong>Troy Ave</strong>: "Troy Ave is the next artist out of NYC. He has the streets buzzing and heavy airplay on NY radio without a major deal. Great artist and this is a great summertime jam. The remix is even crazier with <a href=#><strong>Puff Daddy</strong></a>, <strong>Mase</strong>, and <strong>T.I.</strong>"</p><p>"2 On" by <strong>Tinashe</strong>: "The current women's anthem killing the clubs in New York. As a DJ you want to hear that ROAR from a crowd and this gets that everytime you put it on. Big Salute to Tinashe. She's a great new artist and I love her movement. She can sing and dance her ass off."</p><p>"The Walker" by <strong>Fitz and the Tantrums</strong>: "This is an anthem and it's just a perfect song in every way. It's like a marching soul funk rock song with gospel influences. It's got so many things that are right with this, so many elements, that it just makes you shake your head at the genius of it. Pure genius."</p><p>"Sing" by <strong><a href=#>Ed Sheeran</a></strong>: "Perfect summertime jam. You just feel alive when this song is on. You'll be hearing it through the summer. And rightfully so. Straight banger."</p><p>"Am I Wrong" by <strong>Nico & Vinz</strong>: "Now this is one of my favorite songs at the moment. It has my vote as the next 'Someone that You Used to Know.' You know how you always have that one song that comes out of nowhere and everybody loves it? This is it. Absolutely."</p><p>"Latch" by <strong>Disclosure</strong>: "This song is so beautiful that it's haunting. How could one song be so perfect in every way? Big shout to Disclosure. Those dudes are bad."</p><p>"Dontcha" by <strong>The Internet</strong>: "This is a great nu-soul funk group. Everything about this song just feels like a warm breeze. Beautiful vocals and just an amazing song."</p><p>"Foreign" by <strong>Trey Songz</strong>: "It's probably a tie between this and his other single "Na Na." Trey is heavy in the NYC clubs and the airwaves with these. These are just sonically perfect. Especially for the summer. Trey is a bad dude. Definitely love these."</p><p>"Around the Way Girl" by <strong>LL Cool J</strong>: "This is an oldie but goodie. This song embodies that warm summer feeling of just being outside and everything being right with the world. You can't listen to this song without a smile coming across your face. Your head just nods on instinct to this one."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Summertime" by <strong>DJ Jazzy Jeff & <a href=#>The Fresh Prince</a></strong>: "And the impervious inescapable absolute-must for any summertime playlist. It's not even contrived having this in the list. It's an absolute perfect song. You know a song is perfect when you don't want it to end. Am I right? Absolutely."</p><p>Tell Us: What are your must-hear songs for summer?&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadol2nrrS0wJ1koZmpmsBuudSsoJxloKGuurjIrKtmamBmgXOClWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
