It sold $49,000 in tickets at the Loew’s Village 7, beating the theater’s single-day record of $43,435 held by 1997’s Men in Black, according to distributors Lions Gate Films and IFC Films.

Lee, 41, was there to play DJ during a Father’s Day party, the club’s marketing director, Sean Christie told the Las Vegas Sun. “He was playing lousy music,” Christie said. “We told him to wrap up his set and make a graceful exit. When he refused, we said we would just pull the plug on him, which is what we ended up doing.” In a statement to AP, Lee’s manager said, “Tommy walked out of the venue … after 30 minutes into the show since it was clear that the ‘club’ management wanted him to play top 40 hip-hop tunes for their lounge.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Oauaau0aKrsmeTpLmquoyfmKuqlaG5tHnFrqOlZZ6qsaZ50pycp51dnLK1v4ycrK1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
