And I mean, YouTube, I've never been able to find any of his videos, unless they are uploaded by a third party.</p><p>"The video with the wife, I did not see that until I got on my sister's YouTube and pulled up his channel. And that's when I was like 'Ok, he must have me blocked on YouTube.'</p><p>"After your videos, I blocked him last night. He started to text me from a different phone number and he said 'I need to speak with you. Allow me to explain this, face-to-face.'"</p><p>According to Tasha, Derrick found out about Nikki coming on the show to talk about her affair with him, and he served her with a gag order.</p><p>Allegedly, he also told his third mistress that if she spoke out against him, "he could lose everything" in terms of deals worth over $100,000.</p><p>The Sun has reached out to Derrick for comment, but didn't receive any response at the time of publication.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000643218210-4.jpg><p>This third mistress' story comes after Derrick admitted <a href=#>he had cheated on his wife</a> of four years and partner of 14 years.</p><p>During his confession video, where he held hands with his wife, he spoke in the third person.</p><p>"Derrick Jaxn was involved with other women outside of the marriage," he began.</p><p>"And by involved, I want to be clear, I'm not talking about kicking it, some lunch. I'm talking about things as serious as sex, sexual flirtation, and that kinda thing. And some things that may be considered ok by some in terms of chatting and checking in with people who I had a previous encounter with, but without my wife's knowledge and with us having a sexual history, all of it falls under the umbrella of inappropriate, cheating, affair, stepping out.</p><p>"Definitely not in line with the vows that I took and certainly not in alignment with the biblical standard of what it means to be faithful, which is the standard that I'm going by now."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000643216960-3.jpg><p>The YouTuber – who claimed <a href=#>he was also indulging in drugs and alcohol</a> – insisted that his wife is now aware of all his misdeeds.</p><p>He said: "I need to let you guys know that I don't stand by those actions, I don't encourage, and I know I can't build a platform preaching certain things and then in my real life, live contrary to that and think that I can't be held accountable.</p><p>"And Derrick Jaxn is no exception, he's not exempt from that. I'm also not a victim, nobody made me do [this video], [my wife] didn't push me, the next person didn't. I made decisions and now I gotta account for.</p><p>"I've made that bed and now I have to lie in it."</p><p>After his confession,&nbsp;<a href=#>Da'Naia</a>&nbsp;– whom <a href=#>fans believe was forced to join him in the video</a> – also addressed their fans and said: "I agree with what he just said, there is no justification for bringing other women into our marriage on any level and it was unacceptable.</p><p>"It's not something that I tolerate or we tolerate moving forward and when I've been flooded with messages that I need to leave and why haven't I left, the answer is that when I found about it, I left.</p><p>"I didn't hesitate or waste time to do so. And I stayed gone, no matter how many times he came, I stayed gone and stayed firm in my decision and I did not come back until I saw a shift and change in his mentality and how he carried himself and how he presented himself in conversations that we were able to have that we were never able to have in 12 years of knowing each other."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000643200633-2.jpg><p>She continued: "When we were able to have these dialogues and said 'Ok Lord, this is something that you've had your hand on,' and this is me being completely removed from his life and with him continuing to pursue God and continuing to eliminate these things that led up to the catastrophe that you guys are seeing for the&nbsp;first time.</p><p>"So there's nothing out there right now that is information I don't already know about or haven't known about and this is not something that is new. We have moved forward, we have gotten counsel for it and continue to do so.</p><p>"He is still pursuing God and seeking guidance or wise counsel from men of God. And that is what I needed in the continuation of me being present in this marriage and to stay by his side.</p><p>"So today, where I'm at, it's at peace and by his side and I have no hesitation or hurt or shame about that, and it's only because of the grace of God and the mercy of God. And we have already turned a new chapter in this story and we are continuing to move forward and we are just now sharing this with you, and I forgave him and most importantly, God has forgiven him and the others as well. And we are in that free to move forward.
