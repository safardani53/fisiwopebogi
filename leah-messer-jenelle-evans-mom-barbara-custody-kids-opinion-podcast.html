Barbara confirmed that she currently has custody of Jace and Ensley after a North Carolina judge reportedly refused to return Jenelle and <strong>David Eason’s</strong> children home on May 28, and a day later, Leah went on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Life Reboot&nbsp;podcast</a> to give her two cents about this custody drama.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I just hope that, no matter what, Ensley and all the other kids are in great homes,” Leah began, as Jenelle’s other child, <strong>Kaiser</strong>, 4, is reportedly with his paternal grandmother and father <strong>Nathan Griffith</strong> — for now. Meanwhile, David’s daughter <strong>Maryssa</strong> has been reported to be under the care of mother <strong>Whitney Johnson</strong>. Leah then took aim at Barbara, adding, “In my opinion, I don’t mean this— I like Barbara, she’s funny and she’s great for TV; however, I also feel like it was a familial cycle that Jenelle got washed up in, and just like I had been. And I don’t feel like it’s great for any of the kids to be with Barbara either.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Leah didn’t elaborate on her point, as she bluntly added, “That’s my opinion, take it or leave it.” To be fair, Leah didn’t think co-stars <strong>Kailyn Lowry</strong> and <strong>Chelsea Housk</strong> should take on the role of Ensley’s caregiver, either. “I think that would just be a lot of controversy if either of them got Ensley at the end of the day, being another talent on the show that [Jenelle] was previously on,” Leah explained on Wednesday’s podcast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/jenelle-evans-david-eason-lose-custody-of-their-3-kids-post-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>More Teen Mom&nbsp;cast members, past and present, have chimed in after Jenelle and David couldn’t regain custody of their kids. “After losing their kids — and now, they need to take parenting classes, drug tests and therapist – I would say all the moms on Teen Mom need to take parenting courses and all of the above. It’s sad for Jenelle — she chooses fame and attention before her kids,” <strong>Farrah Abraham</strong> EXCLUSIVELY told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>, adding, “No more crying police calls, recording a man treating you bad — she needs to learn to value herself. I feel bad for how broken she is.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Meanwhile, Kailyn and Coffee Convos&nbsp;co-host <strong>Lindsie Chrisley</strong> believed it “is in the best interest of the children to remain outside of Jenelle and David Eason’s care,” which they wrote in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>joint statement to&nbsp;People</a>. Despite her former co-stars’ opinions, Jenelle revealed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in a public statement</a> that she “will do anything necessary to get [her children] back,” as she gears up for her and David’s next court date that is reportedly scheduled for June 4.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH12e5FyZqWdkZ16rrHSrJyrZZqau6a4y55knq6Ro8Buuc6mZJuZopeus62MnKysrJ%2BZxm63yJ2qZqegnruqu81mp6ick5bAtXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
