The reality singing competition, hosted by the "Work It" rapper, aired on UPN for just one season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Betts won The Road to Stardom, but it didn't propel her career forward. In 2012, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Ebony</a> why she didn't capitalize on her win. "I think after the realization of winning the show, I had to take time to find myself," she said.

In the video, Nash was wearing her character's wedding dress while Betts sat next to her, singing and playing guitar.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But that wasn't the only time that the couple shared the screen.

During an appearance on Red Table Talk, Nash shared that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she was reluctant</a> to date at first. "I was fearful that our friendship might not survive it," she said.

"My wife and I, we say all the time, representation matters, it really does," she said.
