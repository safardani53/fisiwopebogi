It was like, ‘Wow, does that mean I am gay?’”</p><p>Wait, whatt????</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/jason-mraz-photo-922x1024.jpg><p>Mraz was sleeping with men while dating his very serious girlfriend and now-wife???</p><p>Yes.</p><p>And he continued in this interview:</p><p>"My wife laid it out for me. She calls it ‘two spirit,’ which is what the Native Americans call someone who can love both man and woman. I really like that.”</p><p>Oh, ummm. Okay then. Two spirit sexuality. There you have it, folks.</p><p>According to The New York Times,&nbsp;“Two Spirit” was a term coined in the early 1990s at a conference for gay and lesbian Native Americans.</p><p>It was used then as an umbrella phrase with no specific description of gender or sexual orientation.</p><p>Might that explain why Mraz, as you can see above and below, often holds up two fingers for his fans?</p><p>Possible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/jason-mraz-pic-841x1024.jpg><p>Mraz and Christina Carano got married in October of 2015 after four years of dating; they exchanged vows at the time in an intimate outdoor ceremony in Virginia.</p><p>The songwriter announced the news on Instagram back then, gushing that he was “the luckiest man in the world."</p><p>“I felt an instant connection to her and have admired her integrity and practices since day one,” Mraz said years ago of Carano.</p><p>“She is whole-hearted in every action, is extremely generous, completely drama-free, and has the most intuitive-genius-mind in the kitchen.</p><p>"Not to mention her smile absolutely melts me.”</p><p>It’s also worth noting that this isn’t the first time Mraz has opened up about his sexuality.</p><p>In a 2005 interview with Genre magazine, the singer said he was “bisexually open-minded,” telling the publication:</p><p>“I have never been in a sexual relationship with a man. If the right one came along, then sure.”</p><p>In this case, he concluded:</p><p>“I had a gay friend I was hanging out with just about every day. We were basically best friends. It took me about three months before I realized, ‘Oh my god, we’re dating.’</p><p>"Right before I moved to California, he gave me a pretty strong-willed kiss goodbye, which I have never experienced before.</p><p>"Unfortunately, he had a little bit more facial hair than I like.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/07/jason-mraz-pic-841x1024.jpg><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WEcLbArKanZZ2nrrt5yK%2BcZqyfqa6tuNhmqqWdoKl6uLXToWSmnZ5k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
