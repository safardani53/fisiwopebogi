The body recognises the scent of someone new and responds far more enthusiastically to this than something it's smelt lots of times before.</p><p>Smell works on a primal level, which is why using feminine deodorant can actually decrease a man's sexual pleasure, not make it more pleasant.</p><p>The man who is buying used socks, has a foot fetish that can't be satisfied another way.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">How to stay safe when selling trashed goods online</h3></p><p>Make sure you stay safe and are not made to feel uncomfortable at any time.</p><p>Don’t allow sellers to pick up the goods from you, and make sure you keep your messages between the website's messaging system - don’t hand out your email address.</p><p>If you are going to have an Amazon wish list, then remove your surname and make sure items aren’t just from marketplace sellers. Amazon already knows your address, marketplace sellers will want to know.</p><p>Remember, if you are feeling uncomfortable at any time, you can always report a buyer's behaviour to the moderator.</p><h2>'Men like to buy my old shoes when they're sweaty and covered in toe prints'</h2><p><strong>Eliza Wilde, 33 is a dancer and model from London.
