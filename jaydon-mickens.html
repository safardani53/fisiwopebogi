His jersey number was one that was very famous during his senior year at his college.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, Mickens played college football at Washington, where he participated in most of his career by changing his jersey number from 4 to 1.</p><p>This happened between his junior and senior years before he qualified for the 2016 NFL Draft.</p><p>He had decent but unstable numbers, leading the team in catches and receiving yards for his junior and senior seasons but never cracking the conference’s Top 10.</p><p>He was also his freshman year’s Huskies kick returner but only returned four points during his college career, scoring no touchdowns in either position.</p><p>Also check out: <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>&lt;&lt;Justin Strzelczyk – Bio, Family, NFL, Car Accident & Death >></strong></a></p><h2>Professional Career</h2><p>Jaydon Mickens used to play for Washington huskies football while he was in his college. Later, he also played for NFL teams such as Oakland Raiders, Carolina Panthers, and Jacksonville Jaguar.</p><p>In the year 2016, Jaydon was selected by Oakland Riders in practice Squad. He then played for the team in the year 2017 before his leave on September 2, that very day.&nbsp;</p><h3>Oakland Raiders</h3><p>On May 12, 2016, as an undrafted free agent, Mickens signed with the Oakland Raiders. On September 3, 2016, he was waived by the Raiders and was signed to the practice squad the next day.</p><p>Moreover, Jaydon signed a reserve/future contract with the Raiders on January 9, 2017, after spending the entire 2016 season on the practice squad. On September 2, 2017, he was waived by the team.</p><h3>Jacksonville Jaguars</h3><p>Mickens was signed to the Jacksonville Jaguars practice squad on September 19, 2017. On October 21, 2017, he was promoted to the active roster.</p><p>Likewise, in Week 9, he recorded a 63-yard punt return touchdown in the fourth quarter in a 23-7 win against the Cincinnati Bengals, earning him the AFC Special Teams Player of the Week.</p><p>Jaydon had a 72-yard punt return in Week 14 but was stopped on the one-yard line, which set up a touchdown to give the Jaguars a 14-point lead over the Seattle Seahawks. They won honors as AFC Special Teams Player of the Week.</p><p>However, he had just one reception before Week 15 as a receiver but had four in a playoff-clinching 45-7 win over Houston for 61 yards and two second-quarter touchdowns.</p><p>After suffering a fractured ankle in Week 6, Mickens was placed on injured reserve on October 15, 2018.</p><h3>Carolina Panthers</h3><p>The Carolina Panthers signed Mickens on July 24, 2019. On August 30, 2019, during the final roster cuts, he was waived.</p><h3>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h3><p>Similarly, Mickens was signed to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers practice squad on December 19, 2019. On December 24, 2019, he was promoted to the active roster.</p><p>Also, on July 31, 2020, he was waived but re-signed on August 9. On November 14, 2020, Jaydon was placed by the team on the reserve/COVID-19 list and activated on November 30.</p><p>Then on December 7, 2020, he was waived and re-signed to the practice squad two days later.</p><p>Mickens was added to the active roster on December 30, 2020. Besides, Jaydon Mickens is now the champ of the Super Bowl.</p><h3>Promotion to Active Roaster</h3><p>On Wednesday, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers promoted wide receiver Jaydon Mickens to the active roster and, in a corresponding move, placed running back Kenjon Barner on Injured Reserve.</p><p>This year, Mickens was more of a unique team contributor to the Bucs than an offensive threat.</p><p>Similarly, he caught just seven passes on ten goals for 58 yards while being buried behind Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, <a href=#>Antonio Brown</a>, Scotty Miller, and Justin Watson on the depth chart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jaydon-Mickens-2-300x200.jpg><p>Moreover, this year, the 27-year-old returned 15 points for 99 yards and 12 kickoffs for 289 total yards in nine games.</p><p>Mickens will probably continue to work exclusively on special teams for the rest of the season, so fantasy administrators should ignore him.</p><h3>Rejoins Buccaneers After Clearing Waivers</h3><p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers kick/punt returner Jaydon Mickens was placed on Monday’s waivers, but only a day later, after not being claimed, he rejoined the team’s practice squad.</p><p>This year, Mickens accounted for 388 yards on 27 returns, while his place on special teams seems to have been ceded to Kenjon Barner.</p><p>Moreover, Mickens has made just seven catches for 58 yards this season with a glut of options at wide receiver, rendering him more integral than as an individual asset to the Buccaneers’ Defense/special teams unit.</p><p>As a result, Tampa Bay has emerged as a premier D/ST regardless of who returns kicks, owing to its defense’s stingy nature, especially against the run.</p><p>At this point, before meriting fantasy significance, Mickens will first have to earn his way back onto the active roster.</p><h3>Buccaneers Waiving Jaydon Mickens</h3><p>According to a report, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are <a href=#>renouncing wide receiver/kick returner</a> Jaydon Mickens on Monday.</p><p>This year, Mickens was productive for the team, catching seven passes and returning 21 kicks/punts.</p><p>However, he hasn’t played since Week 9, and this season he had 58 receiving yards on his seven receptions.</p><p>In 2019, Mickens did not play at all and had just 13 catches in three NFL seasons for 135 yards and two touchdowns, with his first two coming in Jacksonville.</p><p>Similarly, with Tampa’s wide depth behind receivers Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, <a href=#>Antonio Brown</a>, Scotty Miller, Justin Watson, and rookie Tyler Johnson, Mickens is no longer on the roster.</p><h2>Professional Experience</h2><p>In his recent year of career, Jaydon was selected by the Oakland Raiders in the practice squad. Similarly, he also played for the team in the year 2017.</p><p>After the waiver from Riders, he was signed by Jacksonville Jaguar and Carolina Panthers. Furthermore, on December 19, 2019, he finally settled with Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p><h3>The struggle of Jaydon Mickens</h3><p>Mickens, who grew up in South Central Los Angeles, said flatly, “I came from nothing. I came from nothing.”</p><p>To this, he then added,&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve been through much worse. And now he’s experiencing a much better experience.”</p><p>Impressive given that during his Washington college career, Mickens, who is classified at 5-foot-11 and 170 pounds, returned just four points for 21 yards (5.3 average), none during his senior season in 2015.</p><p>Mickens knows a practice squad player’s wayward life better than anyone. The Californian-native was signed to the Jaguars’ practice squad 15 days later, after being cut for the third time in a year by Oakland on September 4.</p><p>Before he was listed on the active roster on October 21, Mickens stayed there as the team searched for a boost on special teams and depth at receiver ahead of an Indianapolis Week 7 game.</p><p>Likewise, Mickens said his paychecks while on the practice squad were around $6,500 a week to save money during that period compared to the $465,000 annual rookie minimum he earns now.</p><p>Mickens said that before finding a place to park their cars and go to sleep, he and receiver Larry Pinkard would hang out late with teammates.</p><p>You might also want to read: <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>&lt;&lt;Tomas Rosicky: Early Life, Family, Wife & Net Worth >></strong></a></p><h2>Achievements</h2><p>This week, after his 72-yard return, he managed to set up a third-quarter touchdown during a Sunday win over Seattle.</p><p>Mickens also became the first returner in franchise history to win two AFC Special Teams Player of the Week awards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jaydon-Mickens-300x199.jpg><p>Last month, after returning a punt for a 63-yard touchdown against Cincinnati, Mickens won the award for the first time, becoming the Jaguars’ fifth player.</p><p>Similarly, he also became the first to take a punt back for a score since Rashad Greene in 2015.&nbsp;</p><h2>College
