Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.-inspired door</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Rest in power Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.!

This door showcases one of Dr. King's notable quotes and the hands of people of different shades displaying that they will choose love instead of hate.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6.

A Ruby Bridges-inspired door</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>This teacher decided her class would create a <a href=#>Ruby Bridges</a>-inspired door.

This was during the New Orleans school desegregation crisis on Nov. 14, 1960.</p><p>The teacher used the door-making project to show students that while we don't all look the same, we all deserve to be represented.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9.
