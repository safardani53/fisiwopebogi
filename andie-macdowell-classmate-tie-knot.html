The hour-long, evening wedding took place at the Central United Methodist Church and was followed by a reception at Biltmore Forest Country Club. The couple intends to live nearby. “It was just real sweet and simple,” MacDowell’s sister, Babs Rogers Richard, who lives in Waxhaw, N.C., told the Associated Press about the ceremony. MacDowell’s 15-year-old son, Justin, walking down the aisle in crutches after having torn a ligament in his leg during a basketball game the night before, gave his mother away. Justin’s father is model and construction worker Paul Qualley, from whom MacDowell was divorced in 2000, after 14 1/2 years of marriage. In all, they had three children. “Both her daughters (Sarah Margaret, 7, and Rainey, 12), the nieces and nephews were involved in the wedding,” Richard said. <span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"></span>The bride wore a strapless, satiny oyster white Vera Wang gown, and her hair was accented with shiny antique hair clips. MacDowell graduated from Gaffney High School in South Carolina in 1976, a year before Hartzog. They became reacquainted last year (MacDowell invited Hartzog to lunch in Atlanta, where he sold jewelry), and they announced their engagement this past July.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Oauaau0aKrsmeRo7GqsYymmJycn6yyrbiMnKOaq6OirrWxjK2gnmWbo7y1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
