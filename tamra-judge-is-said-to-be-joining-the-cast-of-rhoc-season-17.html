Tamra Judge is ready to return to the Bravo program after being off for two years.&nbsp;During BravoCon 2022, Judge said that she was shocked to be asked to return for season 17 of RHOC. She expressed her sadness and talked about the intense feelings she had when she was dismissed.</p><p>She went on to say:</p><p>“I got to the point where I was weeping in a fetal posture for the first year. I was upset about not being on the scene, about everyone else shooting, and about everything else.”</p><p>She described her surprise upon receiving the call. She remembered them stating they wanted to see her, which she couldn’t believe since she still didn’t know why she was booted from RHOC and wanted to return.&nbsp;Vicki Gunvalson, who, like Tamra, departed the show after season 14, is also returning. While word of Vicki’s comeback is fresh, when the reality TV star learned that her pal Tamra was slated to return to RHOC, she expressed her excitement for her.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tamra-Judge-1.jpg alt="Tamra Judge" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She went on to say:</p><p>“If I wasn’t, I’d be a terrible buddy. Yes, I suffer from FOMO. I’m just like every other lady who feels this way.”</p><p>Tamra joined the RHOC ensemble in season 3 and remained in a key role until season 14 when she was sacked. In 2020, she went on Instagram Live and told Andy Cohen that her termination was motivated by money. She also expressed her grief, saying she had been sobbing and was unable to eat or sleep.</p><h2>Tamra Judge was too costly for RHOC.</h2><p>When Tamra Judge and Vicki Gunvalson were sacked from Bravo, people assumed it was because the network wanted to recruit younger talent, but this was not the reason. Tamra announced her absence from the program on social media. In an Instagram post, she stated:</p><p>“It’s been an eventful 12 years. But it’s time for me to move on; I’m sorry to go but enthusiastic about what lies ahead. I adore you two.”</p><p>Although Judge loved her time on the program, for the most part, she voiced her dissatisfaction with being depicted negatively on multiple times in 2019 and even held the producers accountable.&nbsp;The network was prepared to give Judge a “friend” role in coming seasons, but she declined. Andy Cohen said that he gave her the opportunity to “finish up her narrative line” in season 15, but she declined since she did not want to return to a restricted role.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tamra-Judge-2.jpg alt="Tamra Judge" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He stated:</p><p>“We had given her three episodes to return and finish her narrative…That is correct. She was adamantly opposed to doing so. She’s been on the program for 12 years, after all. We wanted to send her out in style.”</p><p>Judge talked about RHOC on the Everything Iconic podcast. She told Danny Pellegrino that it was a fantastic run and that she was glad it occurred.</p><p>She went on to say:</p><p>“If it came to the stage where I was buddy status. I’m finished. I’ve had a long journey. It was a fantastic run. I’m glad that occurred. If that’s the case, I simply don’t see the point – I’m either all in or all out.”</p><p>Season 17’s official release date has yet to be revealed. Season 16 concluded in April of this year. The next season of Real Housewives of Orange County is unlikely to be published before 2023.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>RHOC</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Tamra Judge</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirmqWilnqrwcOgnGaho2LAorXDZquoZZKaequ7yKegp59dqbWmecKaqq1ln5t6s7TOnGSsnZGovK95kHBm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
