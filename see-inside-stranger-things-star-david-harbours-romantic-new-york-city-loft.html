"The floors were uneven, there was crappy drywall. There were two bathrooms placed right next to each other that served no purpose other than to make it a two-bathroom."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Max Burkhalter</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because it felt more than a little run down, the price was right, and Harbour went full steam ahead on the renovations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Knowing that he would be shooting Stranger Things in Atlanta for nearly a year, Harbour enlisted the help of Kyle O'Donnell of Gramercy Design to overhaul the 1,400-square-foot space in his absence. O'Donnell worked to maintain the historic integrity of the building, which was once a wagon wheel factory, while also tweaking it to suit <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Harbour's personal style</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Max Burkhalter</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout the 10-month process, the former factory was stripped down and restored from the floor up. The two bathrooms were combined into one, five closets were added for storage and an antique tin ceiling was installed, maintaining the space's old-school aesthetic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Almost all the 11-foot walls are painted pure white, but warm shades of red, orange and brown add pops of color throughout the space. Massive bookshelves and plenty of plants break up the loft's largely open floor plan.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Max Burkhalter</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Harbour is quite fond of both his new greenery and literary surroundings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's the best sort of air purifier you can buy, and also just makes the place feel kind of alive and messy in the way that I like," he says of his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>new role as a plant dad</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Vanna White Takes Us Inside Her "Home Away From Home" Dressing Room</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It feels romantic in a way," he continues, referencing the many books in the apartment.
