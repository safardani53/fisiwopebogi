This relationship has been celebrated on the show, with Eugene (Josh McDermitt) and Stephanie singing Iron Maiden lines to each other in Season 10. Eat the Rich, a song by fellow English heavy metal band Motorhead, is included in episode 11X10. The music is an excellent accompaniment to the Commonwealth, one of the few sophisticated settlements in the zombie apocalypse. The riveting episode is presently available on AMC Plus.</p><p>So, when People asked Josh McDermitt how The Walking Dead’s later seasons became so heavy metal, he replied:</p><p>“Yeah, I’ve always appreciated how the program has experimented with various sorts of music. Eugene, on the other hand, always struck me as a metalhead. I occasionally listen to hard metal to get into Eugene’s mindset. So the fact that we’re able to include it into the program is fantastic.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Josh-McDermitt-2.jpg alt="Josh McDermitt" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>McDermitt sang “Where the Wild Wind Blows” without knowing it, but he put it to his playlist.</p><p>“There’s a lot of room for that type of music. And if we do some nice jazz, if we throw some Dave Koz in there, I believe the program will transport us to a place where we can relax with some boxed wine and watch some humans slaughter some walkers. You’re aware that there is entertainment.”</p><h2>Today marks the start of the second of three blocks of The Walking Dead Season 11!</h2><p dir=ltr lang=en>THANK YOU for tuning in to tonight’s <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#TalkingDead</a>!!
