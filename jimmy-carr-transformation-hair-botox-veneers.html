I got every tooth in my head done in one sitting.</p><p>"I did 12 hours in the chair the first day, then 12 hours the second, it was like a three day thing where you’ve got temporary things on, it’s pretty full on.</p><p>"I think they gave me Rohypnol intravenously into the vein and you’re kind of out of it and they do everything and you’re fine. It’s a dream-like haze, you’re in a weird space."</p><p>Jimmy said he didn't fancy having a face lift because it would change his appearance and wouldn't necessarily make him look "better".</p><p>He said: "I think that thing of age is that people don’t really see what’s there, people are good at pattern recognition, that’s all they do, teeth and hair.</p><p>"Maintaining is the thing, I don’t think there’s anything you can do plastic surgery wise, or augmentation wise, that makes you look better, you can just sort of stay the same, that’s what you can hope for."</p><p>Gabby later told him: "Your hair’s gone a bit chestnutty?"</p><p>And he replied: "It’s got a bit of something.

It was just post lockdown I got it done."</p><p>Jimmy admitted tweaking his face and adding hair isn't what really matters to him.</p><p>He said he's been exercising more and looking after himself with food supplements and he has felt the physical benefits.</p><p>He said: "The cosmetic stuff is sort of nonsense, it’s the feeling better.
