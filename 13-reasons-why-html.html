Is the story of Hannah revealing her struggles through&nbsp;cassettes based on a real event? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>’13 Reasons Why’ Is Loosely Based on Real Events</h2><p>In a 2017 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Coming Soon</a>, Asher, the author of the book, revealed that the characters and the story of the series, as well as the book, were loosely based on real-life situations.</p><p>“All of the reasons Hannah describes were based, at least loosely, on situations I’d either experienced or heard about, mostly from my wife or close female friends,” he explained.</p><p>He continued to share that even though Hannah was not&nbsp;specifically based on anyone, her character and the situations she got into always felt real. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“But, years before I came up with the premise, a close relative of mine attempted suicide when she was also a junior in high school. When I eventually did come up with the idea, it was obvious why it came to me as a female in high school,” he added.</p><p>Besides, there is also a documentary about the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">creation of 13 Reasons Why</a> and the mental health issues portrayed in the series. The documentary is titled 13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons and there are three episodes streaming on Netflix.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Jay Asher on the Impact of '13 Reasons Why'</h2><p>During the previous conversation,&nbsp;Asher further talked about the impact Hannah’s story had on people.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He first admitted that it was a hard pill to swallow for viewers to watch someone go through such a level of assault and eventually suicide.</p><p>But he felt people also realized how things could go wrong because of bullying and why one should not do it against anyone.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“It needs to be uncomfortable to read or watch. If it’s not, and we pull away, it felt like the story would only contribute to that problem of not truthfully tackling these things. We’re already good at avoiding uncomfortable subjects, and that needs to change,” he said about the topic.</p><h2>’13 Reasons Why’ Had a Successful Four-Season Run</h2><p>After getting a good response from viewers and critics, the show successfully aired for four seasons on Netflix. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>While the first two seasons focused on Hannah’s story, the third and fourth seasons had a few new characters along with old ones.</p><p>However, the series was intact in showing raw emotions and struggles of characters due to issues like bullying and sexual assault.</p><p>The fourth and final season of 13 Reasons Why was premiered on June 5, 2020. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaGljYr%2BmrdKopaxlp53Gb7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
