Just worried about you. You haven't rang back or, you know, text me or anything.</p><p>"It's probably nothing… Probably fell asleep. I am just worried that's all. I had a fun time earlier. Anyway I will see you tomorrow. Love you… ooh… I didn't say that. Oh ****."</p><p>Analysing why McCullam did this and then went out for drinks, Dr Hill explained: "It is a very common thing to carry on as normal after they have committed a crime like this."</p><p>Megan was found in the early hours of August 8 after police used GPS to track her phone, McCullam was later arrested.</p><p>Chilling <a href=#>footage of the discovery and of police ringing up McCullam</a> were shared by Leicestershire police.</p><p>Cops scoured his house&nbsp;after discovering evidence the lab technician had fought for her life, including her Fitbit watch ripped from her wrist and found on the living room floor.</p><p>There was also evidence that he had cleaned up bloodstains on the carpet at the Windsor Close address - telling his parents a damp patch was caused by a spilled cup of coffee.</p><p>At Leicester Crown Court on Tuesday McCullam showed no remorse and laughed as he recalled the brutal murder of his girlfriend.</p><p>"All of that suggests a lack of empathy, a lack of remorse - all of that you see with sexual sadists", the ex-cop warned.</p><p>He added how the killer's attempts to blame the killing on a "volcano rage" and being abused as a child was a failed effort to convince the jury he is a victim.</p><p>And it was McCallum also attempting to "rationalise" why he killed his 23-year-old girlfriend - a blatant giveaway of an evil killer.</p><p>In a statement, released by Leicestershire Police, Megan's family said she "shone like a star to everyone she came into contact with" and loved dancing and teaching kids.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>They added: "She left home that night in a very happy mood. The thought of what happened to her just hours later - and the evil facing her - is something we can't escape."</p><p>McCullam was found guilty of murder and is due to be sentenced before the same court on Friday December 16.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/c046691f-41ef-41ba-bf8e-d88e519f1222.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/lived-family-parents-attacked-throttling-782481542.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/a1a27cd5-51e7-44a2-8b10-54898fe30c20.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/a98a2422-3cc0-41fd-9b2d-08b8e379f612.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/be8196df-5c15-4e45-bb75-c08acb600b7c-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/lived-family-parents-attacked-throttling-782481582.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ314gJNqbnBnnZq0orqMp5ywmp%2BnvLazx2akrqqUmr9us9Gan5qlXZ22rbiMq6asq12isKTBy6WYpmWcmraksdKtnKtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
