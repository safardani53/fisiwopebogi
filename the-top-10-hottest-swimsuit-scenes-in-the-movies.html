But sales of the two-piece bathing suit skyrocketed after the film's release, which happened to coincide with the beginning of the sexual revolution of the 1960s.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The custom bathing suit, designed by Andress and costume designer Tessa Prendergast to fit her 5' 6", 36-24-36 frame, was auctioned by the actress in 2011 for 35,000 pounds (nearly $60,000).

The "furkini‚Äù might not be the most practical, but the iconic outfit earned her a place in the sex symbol hall of fame. <i>Playboy</i> even crowned her the "most desired woman" of the '70s.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Orion/Warner Bros/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Bo Derek in 10</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the most memorable, and most parodied, bikini moments in Hollywood history came courtesy of Derek's famous, slow-motion beach jog in 1979's <i>10</i>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The comedy starred Dudley Moore as a middle-aged man who believes Derek to be the perfect woman. The beach sequence, which occurs in Moore's dream, showed Derek bouncing towards Moore in a tiny, flesh-toned bikini. The scene, and her cornrow hairstyle, helped make Derek a bona fide Hollywood sex symbol for years to come.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Carrie Fisher in Return of the Jedi</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First came the prehistoric fur bikini, then came the metal slave bikini in space.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Princess Leia's gold bikini in 1983's <i>Return of the Jedi</i> is one of the most famous and recognizable movie costumes of all time, earning the garment a cult following all of its own. The outfit is forced on the wayward princess when she becomes a prisoner of Jabba the Hutt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So uncomfortable to wear, Fisher once quipped that it's "what supermodels will eventually wear in the seventh circle of hell," the bikini is now imitated by cosplay fans at comic book conventions everywhere.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Phoebe Cates in Fast Times at Ridgemont High</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cates brought the ultimate teenage boy fantasy to life in 1982's <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i> with her iconic swimming pool dream sequence.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the scene, Cates' character Linda Barrett, the most popular girl at school, emerges from a swimming pool in a little red bikini and slowly takes her top off for the painfully awkward Brad Hamilton, played by Judge Reinhold.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You know how cute I always thought you were," she says seductively, before leaning in for a kiss.

Lindy Hemming, the film's costume designer, insisted she wear the bikini with a knife as a tribute.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's splashy, it's exciting, it's sexy, it's provocative, it's fun and it will keep me still out there after winning an Oscar," she later told <i>Ebony</i> of her role in the film.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Columbia/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong><a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Demi Moore</a> in Charlie's Angels Full Throttle</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Moore</a> was 40 when she joined <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Cameron Diaz</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Drew Barrymore</a> and Lucy Lui in 2003's Charlie's Angels Full Throttle, but that didn't stop the actress from stealing the show from her younger costars.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The role was something of a comeback for the former <i>St. Elmo's Fire </i>star, who had only made one other film, <i>Passion of the Mind, </i>in the previous six years.
