Both waters extend from the Arctic Ocean, with James Bay being the southernmost part. It is bordered by the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario. The islands in the bay, the largest of which is Akimiski, are part of Nunavut. Many watercourses in the James Bay watershed have been altered by dams or redirected for several large hydroelectric projects. These waterways are also the destination for recreational activities on the river. Several communities are located near or along James Bay, including several Canadian Indigenous communities, such as the Kashechewan First Nation and nine affiliated Cree communities in northern Quebec. Like the rest of Hudson Bay, the waters of James Bay often freeze over in winter. It is the last part of Hudson Bay that freezes in winter and vice versa the first part freezes in summer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/james-bay-1oke-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>Rock Singer James Bay was born on September 4, 1990 in Hitchin, England (He's 33 years old now).</p><p>Singer-songwriter and guitarist best known for her platinum-selling single"Hold Back the River".
