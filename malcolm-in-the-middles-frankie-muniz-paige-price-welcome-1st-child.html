The <a href=#>Malcolm in the Middle </a><a href=#>alum</a> announced on Wednesday, March 24, that wife <strong>Paige Price</strong>&nbsp;had given birth to their first child.</p><p>“I’m a dad guys,” the actor, 34, said in an Instagram Story video. “I love him so much. I love my wife so much.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Malcolm-in-the-Middles-Frankie-Muniz-Welcomes-1st-Child-With-Wife-Paige-Price.jpg><p>Muniz announced in September that they had <a href=#>a little one on the way</a>. “In the past four-and-a-half years, Paige and I have experienced so many incredible things together,” the New Jersey native said in a YouTube video at the time. “We’ve traveled the world, got to live out all these once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. While we still believe it’s the little moments in between the big ones that make you feel happiest, nothing quite compares to the first time hearing your little one’s heartbeat.”</p><p>His wife chimed in, “When we found out that we were expecting, I think we were both in a state of disbelief. We knew that we wanted this but we were told that our chances weren’t that great. The struggle of going to every doctor’s appointment made me feel less and less like a woman. I’m excited to say that we beat the odds and we’re officially 15 weeks along and counting.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/malcolm-in-the-middles-frankie-muniz-paige-price-welcome-1st-child.jpg><p>The couple revealed their March 2021 due date in the footage.

Sometimes, reality has a tendency to overstep your dreams and really surprise you.”</p><p>When speaking exclusively to Us Weekly of <a href=#>their upcoming nuptials</a> five months later, the Big Fat Liar star said, “It’s going to be small. We are both simple. Neither of us wants anything giant. … We really don’t have many friends.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGammZyYvK25jKKlZqyYmnqutcOdo56rXZu%2ForrKopxmpaWjtrt5z5qgoJ1dpb%2Bqr8Rmrp6kk6S6pnmQrKtmm5ieuaV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
