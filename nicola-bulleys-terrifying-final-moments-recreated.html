It's now probably at a slow jogging pace.</p><p>“As you come around the corner you can see the weir in front of us.

A very short scream and my immediate thought was, ‘Somebody is having a bit of fun at the back of the graveyard’.”</p><p>A second woman, Helen O'Neill, told the hearing she was in the garden with her dogs not far from the bench where Nicola disappeared.</p><p>She said: "I heard a scream, it's not an alarming noise, it was just over in a couple of seconds. I'm quite used to hearing the children in the school out back, but it was not that noise.</p><p>"I vividly remember thinking it's unusual at this time. In my head, I had two females, walking along by the river and one jumped out on the other. I didn't think anything of it until later on.</p><p>"There were no other sounds for me to be concerned about."</p><p>Her Fitbit watch and Mercedes car keys were discovered three weeks later when her Nicola's body was recovered.</p><p>The watch had stopped recording Nicola's steps at 9.30am on the day she disappeared.</p><p>However, the inquest heard the watch gave a heart rate output for eight days after she drowned.</p><p>DC Keith Greenhalgh said: “A possible explanation for Nicola’s Fitbit continuing to provide [heart rate] output sporadically until 4 February could be a result of the movement of water passing between the device and Nicola’s wrist.</p><p>“Testing on inanimate objects provided similar results when there was a movement in the water.”</p><p>Mortgage adviser Nicola <a href=#>vanished without a trace</a> after dropping her two daughters, aged six and nine, off at school in St Michael’s on Wyre, <a href=#>Lancashire</a>.</p><p>Tragically, her body was found in the river on February 19 - three weeks after she <a href=#>vanished</a>.</p><p>Her disappearance gripped the nation after it was revealed her mobile was found on a bench by the river still connected to a work conference call.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Nicola's <a href=#>pet springer spaniel Willow</a> was also discovered - but there was no trace still of the mum of two.</p><p>The inquest continues.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Nicola Bulley: How the tragedy unfolded</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/msemail_stg_nicola_bulley_missing1jpg-JS827807243-1.jpg><p><strong>JANUARY 27</strong>: Day she vanished.<br><strong>8.40am:</strong> Witness Claire Che­shire described Nicola as “smiling” on the school run.<br><strong>8.43am: </strong>Nicola walked along the path by the River Wyre after dropping her kids at school.<br><strong>8:50am:</strong> Another dog walker saw her walking pet Willow.<br><strong>8.53am:</strong> Nicola sent an email to her boss.<br><strong>9.01am:</strong> She logged into a Teams work call.<br><strong>9.10am:</strong> She was last seen walking Willow.
