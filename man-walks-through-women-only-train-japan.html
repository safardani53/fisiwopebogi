Then there's <a href=#>this male building maintenance worker</a> who repeatedly made a female tenant uncomfortable and fear for her safety.</p><p>Well, we've got another tale about a dude who seriously overstepped his boundaries with women. And you know what the worst part is? He seems to be purposely acting out just for video views.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">An Australian man faces backlash after walking through a women-only train car in Japan.</h2><p>An Australian man has angered the internet after walking through a women-only train car in Japan.</p><p style=text-align:start>In a <a href=#>TikTok</a> video, creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@shearingshedvlogs</a> shared what “shocked [him] as an Aussie in Japan.” He begins his video by asking the question: "Did you know in Japan that they have women-only carriages?"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@shearingshedvlogs href=#>@shearingshedvlogs</a><p>This “women-only” carriage is the last thing I would expect to be seeing in such a free country like Japan and reminds me of something I would see in a country with strict segregation rules.
