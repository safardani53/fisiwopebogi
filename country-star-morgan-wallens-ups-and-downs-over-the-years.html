Two years after his appearance on the singing competition he signed a deal with Big Loud Records.</p><p>As Wallen started to gain success and praise in the music industry, he had a run-in with the law. The Tennessee native <a href=#>was arrested</a> outside <a href=#><strong>Kid Rock</strong></a>’s Nashville bar, Big Honky Tonk, for public intoxication and disorderly conduct in May 2020. He was later cleared of the charges.</p><p>Following the arrest, Wallen made headlines five months later after TikTok videos showed him partying without a face mask and kissing multiple women at college bars in Tuscaloosa, Alabama amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The “More Than My Hometown” crooner was scheduled to appear on <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> a few weeks later but the NBC comedy series announced shortly after <a href=#>he was no longer welcome</a> to perform after the clips surfaced online citing that he had <a href=#>broken the show’s strict COVID-19 protocols</a>.</p><p>“I’m in New York City, in a hotel room. I was getting ready for SNL this Saturday, and I got a call from the show letting me know that I will no longer be able to play. And that’s because of COVID protocols, which I understand,” he said in October 2020. “I’m not positive for COVID, but my actions this past weekend were pretty short-sighted and that have obviously affected my long-term goals and my dreams. I respect the show’s decision because I know that I put them in jeopardy. I take ownership for this.”</p><p>The following year, Wallen <a href=#>sparked controversy again</a> after TMZ published a video of him saying the N-word in February 2021. Several of the biggest names in country music including <a href=#><strong>Kelsea Ballerini</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Maren Morris</strong></a> and more <a href=#>slammed the CMA winner</a> for his problematic words. While Wallen publicly apologized for his actions he <a href=#>faced several consequences</a> including a <a href=#>brief suspension from his record label</a>, being <a href=#>barred from many awards shows</a> and getting his music taken off of various music platforms.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m embarrassed and sorry. I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back,” he said in a statement at the time. “There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologize for using the word. I promise to do better.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Wallen’s ups and downs over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksLDBza2psmWjqa6zecyoqaCZnmLEorjLnqWsZaWlwG6tzZ1knaeno8Buu9WeqWasmJp6urHAq6po</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
