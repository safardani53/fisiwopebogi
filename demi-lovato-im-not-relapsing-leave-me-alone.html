Don’t believe what you read."</p><p>"People will literally make up stuff to sell a story. Sickening."</p><p>She continued by saying that "If I feel like the world needs to know something, I will tell them MYSELF."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Otherwise people stop writing about my recovery, because it’s no one’s business but mine."</p><p>"I am sober and grateful to be alive and taking care of ME," she insisted.</p><p>Demi did say that "someday I’ll tell the world what exactly happened, why it happened and what my life is like today," but she’s simply not ready to do that right now.</p><p>"Until I’m ready to share that with people please stop prying and making up sh-t that you know nothing about. I still need space and time to heal."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>She also wrote that the people selling these stories about her aren’t actually close to her at all, "because most of the sh-t I see is soooooo inaccurate."</p><p>"I would love to set the record straight on all the rumors out there but I literally don’t owe anyone anything so I’m not going to," she said.</p><p>"All my fans need to know is I’m working hard on myself, I’m happy and clean and I’m SO grateful for their support."</p><p>She finished her rant by tweeting that she’s "so blessed I get to take this time to be with family, relax, work on my mind, body and soul and come back when I’m ready."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I have my fans to thank for that. I’m so grateful, truly. I love you guys so f-cking much."</p><p>So … OK.</p><p>She’s absolutely right in that she doesn’t owe it to anyone to give the details on what happened with her relapse and her overdose.</p><p>It’s great that she feels comfortable taking a break to get herself back together, and she should stay out of the spotlight until she’s truly ready to come back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But Twitter ranting is rarely the sign of a truly healthy, happy person, you know?</p><p>If Demi is really so happy — and we honestly hope she is — then we’d just hope that she wouldn’t feel the need to go off like this on social media.</p><p>Just live your life, girl, please.</p><p>Your fans will definitely stand by you, no matter what.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Demi Lovato: Everything We Know About Her Overdose So Far</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2Z%2FcLDEpqBmpJ%2BrrrW7jKKkZqafqXqzscuap6yhnpx6rbHAr5xmpZVirq27zZ5m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
