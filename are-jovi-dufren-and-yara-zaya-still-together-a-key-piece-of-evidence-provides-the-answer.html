Season 7.</p><p>It’s not really their fault. The show films when it films, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ended up dominating their lives for a while.</p><p>But even though they are too “normal” of a couple to have endless drama, they’ve clashed over a heavy topic this season: where to live.</p><p>Even the most loving couples can split if they cannot agree. Are Jovi and Yara still together? We have the answer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>For almost this entire season, Yara Zaya has been waxing nostalgic about her life in Europe.</p><p>She only just received her Green Card, so she has been unable to travel freely for more than two years.</p><p>And now that she can, she cannot return home. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has turned neighborhoods into killing fields.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But Yara has been able to visit her mother, Olga, in Prague. And she went to see her bestie, Karina, in Germany.</p><p>Both women are now refugees from a brutal war. Their homes are gone.</p><p>We have all followed the news since February with horror. For Yara, this is more personal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Obviously, Yara felt heartbroken at the nightmare that her friends and family had only just escaped.</p><p>And she also felt homesickness. She can’t go live in Ukraine, but she missed a lot about Europe.</p><p>The United States has amazing places to live. New Orleans was not a great fit for Yara, and she at times feels less than happy in a quiet suburb hours north of the city.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But Yara’s desire to spend more time with her mom and with the coffee and cobblestones of Europe is not an easy thing.</p><p>She wants to spend weeks more in Europe, without Jovi. Jovi will have to return to work — which takes him away from home for weeks at a time.</p><p>On its own, that would be an extended break with some risks. But Jovi expressed concerns that Yara’s mother and friend would influence her to want to move to Europe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Late this summer, Jovi held a Q&A on social media to discuss his marriage with fans.</p><p>During that, he admitted that he felt that having Mylah together kept him and Yara’s marriage intact.</p><p>But Jovi very realistically pointed out that having kids brings a lot of couples together — and, frankly, has for millennia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Clearly, this was on Jovi’s mind while filming Season 7, even though that was many months earlier.</p><p>He suggested the idea of having a second child to Yara.</p><p>However, noting that this was not the time and also that childcare for one was overwhelming at times, Yara did not respond well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Technically, we’re going to have to keep watching Season 7 to see where this couple ends up.</p><p>The Tell All, which filmed months ago but also months after Jovi and Yara finished filming the season proper, will certainly have updates.</p><p>But … we can use available information and also common sense. Including a brand new update from this week:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Late this week, Jovi and Yara shared this family photo featuring Santa and a very unhappy Mylah.</p><p>Santa Claus is an ontologically scary concept with alarming worldbuilding implications, but we suspect that Mylah felt tearful because the experience was overwhelming. The people and noise from a visit to a Mall Santa can just be too much for a little kid.</p><p>But this sweet family portrait shows that either Yara and Jovi are still together, or they’re doing a really convincing job of pretending to still be together.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2Z%2FcK3RnmSjp6aeeqXBxaucp2WRo7FuxcCrmGayka6ubr%2FToqOlZaSktKbAx56pZpldoLK6ec%2BinJydXaSzbrHVopueppOaerG%2Bzq%2BgnZ2jYsGpsYyapayvlad8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
