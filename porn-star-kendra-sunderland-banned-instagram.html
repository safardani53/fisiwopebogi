I just wanna let you know I’m not deleted yet… I’m bats**t crazy.</p><p>"I might be sucking off the CEO of Instagram. But whatever it is, I’m here to stay!”</p><p>It came after she posted a topless photo of herself several weeks ago and also joked she was "blowing" Mosseri.</p><p>The photo was allowed to remain up despite her violating Instagram's policy on nude photos.</p><p>The social media giant had been accused of giving her preferential treatment as users tried to report her photos.</p><p>Instagram finally took action on Wednesday night following her live stream and her account has been shutdown.</p><p>The company has categorically denied Sunderland has any connection to Mosseri, a married dad-of-three, or any other executives.</p><p>Sunderland has blamed her actions and jokes on being drunk - and said she isn't sure if she was banned for her X-rated content or claims about the Instagram boss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000625442646.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000625440426.jpg><p>"I was going crazy on Live yesterday, doing things I know I shouldn't have and was just drunk and didn't care. I'm guessing that's why," she said.</p><p>"I would be surprised if the other reason was why because I said it in such a joking manner.</p><p>"I never even really knew who the CEO of Instagram was, or anything. I've never met this person before in my life.</p><p>"I think having my t***ies out shouldn't have been a problem because guys can be shirtless on Instagram Live, and there shouldn't be any difference."</p><p>She has however apologized as she admitted using a sex toy on live stream was perhaps "too far".</p><p>"I'm sorry, Instagram," Sunderland added.</p><p>However, she has also taken aim at the company and accused them of discriminating against sex workers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000625442648.jpg><p>Sunderland wrote: "We all want the same freedom on social media and we all want the discrimination against sex workers to stop.</p><p>"But I hope that u find some sort of satisfaction or happiness to know that my account was disabled.</p><p>"I’m also always blocked from posting on Tik Tok for stupid things other people get away with.</p><p>"These apps clearly target sex workers and I am not exempt.

NO MORE NEGOTIATIONS&nbsp;@INSTAGRAM&nbsp;Hey&nbsp;@mosseri&nbsp;wtf is this? Does your wife know?"</p><p>Evans added; "I'm not always a b***h... but I am when I need to be. I am fighting for thousands of performers deleted by Instagram for simply existing.</p><p>"I hate IG's rules too, but being a t**t and purposely flaunting privilege will bring out the momma bear in me all day..."</p><p>Sunderland responded: "We’re fighting the same fight are u stupid?? I was not 'flaunting privilege' I was defying their bulls**t rules. Saying f**k u to them NEVER to fellow performers.</p><p>"Don’t paint me out to be the bad guy when it’s really IG u should be pissed at honey."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/977393ef-f948-478c-955e-c2266807d6e9.jpg><p>Kendra added: "Women should be allowed to show their nipples like guys do.
