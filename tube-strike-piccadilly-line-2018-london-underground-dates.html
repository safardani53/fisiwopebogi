Other lines are also likely to be busier than usual.</p><h2>Why are rail workers planning a strike?</h2><p>The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said the strikes were called due to attacks on working conditions and staffing levels by London Underground.</p><p>RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: "Our driver members stand rock solid as the strike action gets underway in the fight for respect and justice in the workplace and a safe and supportive working environment on London's crucial Piccadilly Line."</p><p>He added:</p><p>"The attitude of tube managers on the Piccadilly Line has been deliberately provocative and obstructive and it is that stance, including the back-tracking on operational, staffing and safety improvements agreed after previous rounds of action on the line, that led to the current dispute in the first place.</p><p>"The ball is firmly in management's court now but our members are sick and tired of being mugged off with bogus promises of improvements to the current dire industrial relations climate that never actually materialise. That position needs to change."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">LATEST TRAVEL NEWS</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cta_banner_final3.jpg><h2>How do I get to Heathrow?</h2><p>The Piccadilly line serves Heathrow airport with stations for Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3,&nbsp;Heathrow Terminal 4 and&nbsp;Heathrow Terminal 5.</p><p>TfL advises passengers who need to get to the airport to use TfL Rail and Heathrow Express services to and from Paddington station.</p><p>The TfL Rail service is approximately every 30 minutes and takes 35 minutes.</p><p>Heathrow Express does not accept London Underground or Oyster tickets and it is advisable to buy tickets in advance to avoid delays.</p><p>Heathrow can also be accessed by road from the A4/M4.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Coach operators</a> also serve the airport as do <a href=# rel=noopener>London buses</a>.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Commuters battle to get on buses as Tube strike brings further misery</span><br><p><b>We pay for your stories!
