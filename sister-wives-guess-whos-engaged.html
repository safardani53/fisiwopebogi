for the Brown family!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

wife to his arsenal, or that perhaps Meri had had enough and found another man?</p><p>Sorry, it’s nothing that dramatic.</p><p>But it sure is adorable!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Mariah is the only child of Meri and Kody — Meri was unable to have anymore children.</p><p>A couple of years ago, <a href=#>Mariah told her family that she was gay</a>, and although they struggled with the news a bit at first, they’ve become very accepting.</p><p>They even liked Audrey <a href=#>the first time Mariah brought her home to meet them</a>, which was nice, because she was definitely nervous about it.</p><p>It’s also nice that they like her since, you know, they’re getting married.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The two ladies met while attending Westminster College in Salt Lake City, and Mariah has said that she had a crush on Audrey before she even came out.</p><p><a href=#>They moved to Chicago together last year</a>, and they really do seem to be ridiculously in love.</p><p>And at the Women’s March last month in Washington D.C., Mariah popped the question.</p><p>She gave an interview to People about the <a href=#>big news</a>, and she explained that she chose to the location because "We had just started dating when we came for the first time two years ago and it was such a special time for us that I wanted to propose there."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>She said that she "can’t exactly pinpoint" the moment she knew Audrey was the one, "but it was pretty early on."</p><p>"There are a lot of things about Audge that I am so in love with and I knew that I wanted to love those things for the rest of my life," she gushed.</p><p>"She made me a better person and continues to make me a better person."</p><p>As for the big moment itself, Mariah recounted that "We were in the middle of where everyone was marching and I was trying to get the ring out of my pocket, where it was stuck."</p><p>"I think Audrey was fixing her hair, but I just got down on one kneww and said some sweet things that neither of us can really remember because we were so caught up in the moment."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>After that, "She was really sweet and started crying and I was crying and then I put the ring on her, got up and gave her a kiss and someone around us goes ‘Did she say yes?’"</p><p>"And she totally hadn’t yet!"</p><p>"Then she said ‘I do! I do!" and then realized that was the wrong thing to say and then said ‘Yes!’", Mariah continued.</p><p>"She’s such a sweetheart. The ring is absolutely perfect, if I do say so myself."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It’s been about a month since they got engaged, so how are things going now?</p><p>"Our friends and family have all been so excited for us!" Mariah said.</p><p>"I actually think my dad almost cried! He really likes Audrey."</p><p>"All of our friends have been so sweet and offering to help and our families are obviously excited to share their input," she added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Speaking of family, Meri has been very vocal with her excitement about the engagement.</p><p>She shared Mariah’s interview on Facebook and along with it, she wrote "You guys, have you heard?"</p><p>"I am SO excited for my girls (even though they hate being referred to as my girls lol!) Mariah Brown and Audrey Kriss!!"</p><p>"Wishing them all the best forever and always!!" she finished.</p><p>Robyn, Kody’s fourth wife, tweeted "We are so excited! We love them both so much and they are a wonderful couple."</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Meri Brown: 19 Shocking Facts About the Sister Wives Star!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>Kody and his other two wives, Janelle and Christine, haven’t publicly commented on the news yet, but we hope they’re just as excited.</p><p>Congratulations, Mariah and Audrey!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2V%2FcL%2FIrKueql2strex0maerp2jqHq4tM6sZJ6ml5a0prCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
