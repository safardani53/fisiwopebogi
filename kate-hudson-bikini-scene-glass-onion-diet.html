While Kate, 43, looks utterly amazing in that scene, she was ready to put it behind her so she could finally have a much-deserved drink. “While everyone else was having Aperol Spritzes in Greece, I was just waiting for that scene to be shot so I could just join everybody,” Kate said on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>This Morning</a>, explaining that she cut out alcohol to get that bikini body. “Everybody was having a great time. I was like, I’ll take that cucumber and feta.'”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Hudson’s Birdie is “a model turned fashion designer we meet throwing an over-the-top party with her “COVID pod,” while reeling from a Tweet Gone Wrong,” per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a>. Describing her character to This Morning as “bold, very loud, tone-deaf, not that smart,” and a role she was excited to take.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kate-hudson-glass-onion-cut-diet-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I remember reading Birdie, and I was in my sweet spot. [I’ve] been waiting on the sideline. It’s been hard. Because of the way my career has gone, the movies that I’ve wanted to make are not the movies that I’ve been getting,” Hudson told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a>. Before Glass Onion, her last major movie roles were in 2016’s Deepwater Horizon, 2017’s Marshall, and 2021’s Music and Mona Lisa and the Blood Moon. She also appeared in 2021’s Truth Be Told series for ten episodes.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“And so with [director <strong>Rian Johnson</strong>], it was really like,&nbsp;if you just put me in the game, I know I can deliver the goods for you,” added Hudson. She also spoke about how the main challenge in this film was to take Birdie – a “larger than life” character – and ground her. “That for me was the fun part—this deep need to seek validation, to need to be loved, be seen, to be at the center of everyone’s love. Where does that come from?” she told Vanity Fair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kate-hudson-glass-onion-cut-diet-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>“For any character that could be quite unlikable; it’s those things that ground it that make you have a little bit more empathy for this terrible person who is just oblivious to the way she walks, moves through life,” she said. “And that part, to me, is the most important. When I read it, it was the hats, the bathing suit, the outfit, walking out with the outfit. That was all there.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery&nbsp;became Netflix’s sixth-largest film debut, according to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter</a>.
