The pair seemed to be a match made in heaven and were not shy about showing off their love, which is why fans were surprised when they broke up while on a week-long Royal Caribbean cruise. To confirm their seemingly amicable split, Avery shared a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok</a> video from the trip that showed the “D.R.E.A.M.” singer giving her an arcade game prize and saying, “This is my ‘Sorry for Breaking Up With You’ present.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jojo-siwa-Savannah-Demers-flirty-lunch-date-mega-embed21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Things quickly turned sour, though, when JoJo seemingly addressed their separation in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok</a> and said someone, who is thought to be Avery, told one of her best friends that she was only dating her to “get to the top” and help her “growing” career. “And when I said I just wanted to be friends so I didn’t lead you on after an unplanned hookup you wanted nothing to do with me because there was nothing to gain anymore,” she captioned the video.</p><a title=@itsjojosiwa href=# rel=nofollow>@itsjojosiwa</a><p id=content-paragraph-5>And when I said I just wanted to be friends so I didn’t lead you on after an unplanned hookup you wanted nothing to do with me because there was nothing to gain anymore.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><a title="♬ original sound - ✨Poyo✨" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ original sound – ✨Poyo✨</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Avery addressed the claims</a> in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E!

The pair made their relationship public while celebrating their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>one-month anniversary</a> on Feb. 8, 2021.

JoJo and Kylie<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> dated until Oct. 2021</a> and then rekindled their romance in mid-2022. They <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>broke up again</a> two months later.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>JoJo seemingly wears her heart on her sleeve, so if she and Savannah are the real thing, it might not be long before fans find out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ye5ByZqOnmqR6tLXWmmSlrZ6YtW6wwK2cZqyZoMGwt4ysq5qqXaiut63Np5ihZZSauqa%2B0manoaekpMBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
