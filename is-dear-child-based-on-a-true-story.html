The book Dear Child was an international bestseller almost immediately, making it no surprise that a TV adaptation was made.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The director and head writer, Isabel Kleefeld, was interviewed by Netflix. She said:</p><p>"I read the book one night and saw the whole story very vividly in my mind. The material fascinated me immediately. Dear Child is told from the point of view of each of the participants, and the perspective changes again and again. The result is an exciting game with reality, a puzzle that the audience can always add to and reassemble. It is the story of a crime that has many victims, directly or indirectly."</p><p>Isbabel also addressed some changes from the original source material. She said, "I hope my readers feel like I did: There will be many things that are familiar from the book, and at the same time it will feel totally new. For example, a new character (Aida Kurt), who really excited me because she lives the complete opposite of the perpetratorâ€™s imagination."</p><p>Well, at least it's fiction. Dear Child is definitely one of the best thrillers we have seen in a long time.</p><p>Make sure to catch all six episodes of Dear Child streaming now on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBusMSaqWabmJ65pXnBmqqenF2ku26tjK2prp1dqMGwvtg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
