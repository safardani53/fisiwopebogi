While the former Bachelor “doesn’t judge” different ways to imbibe marijuana, he’s preparing to kick his habits.</p><p class=p1>“I have a daughter coming, so I’ve been informed that changes will be made,” Viall said. “Which I honestly appreciate.”</p><p class=p1>He continued: “It’s a disgusting habit. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life and I’ve always taken pride in that, meanwhile, I’m just like, [smoking a joint].”</p><p class=p1>Viall and Joy <a href=#>got engaged in January</a>. Seven months later, they announced that <a href=#>they are expecting their first baby</a>. Amid her pregnancy, Joy, 25, has been vocal about getting Viall to stop smoking.</p><p class=p1>“Listen, our daughter can’t go to preschool and say, ‘My daddy was smoking a blunt at home,’” she said <a href=#>on Thursday’s episode</a>. “Like, no, she can’t do that! I also don’t really want my daughter to smell, like, weed [in our house].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Nick-Viall-Says-Changes-Will-Be-Made-to-Disgusting-Pot-Smoking-Habit-After-Daughter-Is-Born-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>Aside from kicking his vice, Viall and Joy are counting down the days until their baby’s arrival. They even shared her name with Kung Minkoff, 40, but <a href=#>it was bleeped out</a> for listeners. The <i>RHOBH </i>star gushed that she “loves” their choice and even offered to give them a Snoo bassinet for their daughter. (Kung Minkoff was an early investor in the product.)</p><p class=p1>Joy’s pregnancy, however, has not been all sunshine and rainbows as she reaches her final trimester.</p><p class=p1>“I am so tired. How’d you sleep last night, you little bitch?” Joy sarcastically asked Viall at the beginning of the podcast episode. “I know [you slept well] because you snored in my ear all night long while I was awake and our daughter was having a Zumba boxing class in my stomach.”</p><p class=p1>While Viall empathized with Joy’s pregnancy pain, she lamented that “it definitely wasn’t great” and there’s “nothing dainty and light” about the baby’s movements.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“They’re all aggressive and, like, super f—king strong,” Joy said. “And it’s hard when you don’t know what position they’re in.”</p><p class=p1>Viall added that their baby is “really kicking these days.” He said, “Like, you can see it. That’s wild. … I was feeling it and she kicks hard. I don’t know if it’s a kick or a punch or a head-butt.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGanoZOgere1wKWjZq%2BZobluucCknGabmJa7qLHSZquoZaCkwW6%2FzKiioqaXYrWirsitZJqepJq%2Fbq7Am7CsZZKev7W0jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
