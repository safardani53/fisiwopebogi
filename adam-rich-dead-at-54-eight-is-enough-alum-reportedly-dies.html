He was 54.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Eight Is Enough&nbsp;</i>alum was found dead in his Los Angeles home on Saturday, January 7, according to a <a href=#>TMZ</a> report that cited a family member.</p><p class=p1>A cause of death has not been announced at the time of publication.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Former-Eight-Is-Enough-Child-Star-Adam-Rich-Dead-at-54-Report-Inline-2.jpg><p class=p1>Rich <a href=#>rose to fame as a child actor</a>, notably playing youngest Bradford child Nicholas on the sitcom&nbsp;<i>Eight Is Enough</i>.&nbsp;The ABC series&nbsp;ran for five seasons between 1977 and 1981, chronicling the adventures of the Bradford brood’s eight children. Dick Van Patten, <strong>Connie Needham</strong>, <strong>Grant Goodeve</strong>, <strong>Willie Aames</strong>, Lani O’Grady and <strong>Laurie Walters</strong> also starred.</p><p class=p1>“I think [Adam was one of the reasons that the show] was a big success,” Van Patten, who died in 2015 at the age of 86, recalled of working with his former TV son in a throwback&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Archive of American Television&nbsp;</i></a>interview. “People loved him. They named their child ‘Nicholas’ and everything because of him.”</p><p class=p1>He continued: “He was like 7 years old [when we started the show] and<a href=#> he was cute and he was a good actor</a>. He was very natural.”</p><p class=p1>Van Patten also revealed that <a href=#>he kept in touch with Rich — and his other TV children —</a> “every once in a while” via phone calls since they are all “spread out” throughout the United States.</p><p class=p1>Rich continued acting through the years, booking brief TV roles on&nbsp;<i>The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, CHiPs, Silver Spoons&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Baywatch</i></a>. The&nbsp;<i>Code Red&nbsp;</i>alum had taken a step back from the spotlight in recent years, though frequently used his platform to <a href=#>advocate for mental health</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Human beings weren’t built to endure mental illness. The mere fact that some people consider those to be weak, or have a lack of will is totally laughable because it’s the total opposite,” the&nbsp;<i>Dungeons & Dragons</i>&nbsp;actor tweeted in September 2022. “It <a href=#>takes a very, very strong person… a warrior if you will… to battle</a> such illnesses.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Rich retweeted his message the following December after it was confirmed that dancer <a href=#>Stephen “tWitch” Boss</a> <a href=#>died by suicide at the age of 40</a>. “The only thing those suffering from a mental illness know how to do is pretend to be OK,” he wrote via <a href=#>Twitter</a> at the time. “Enough! The stigma is killing people. Be yourself. OK, or not OK, is the only way to create change, & stomp the stigma! Heal your truth.”</p><p class=p1><i>If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or considering suicide, call the&nbsp;<a href=#>988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline&nbsp;</a>at 988.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaanJGierO1wqFknZ2RmXqiwIxua2admZy1tXnIrGSepp%2BqtKl5wKWspmWimr2wvtOem6WxXZm2pr%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
