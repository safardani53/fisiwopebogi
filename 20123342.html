Look at Tate - he came out after six or seven years inside and within five months he was shot.</p><p>"Six weeks after that, he was shot dead. Six months he'd been out and he was shot twice. I'm 60 and I've never been shot.</p><p>"It was obvious to everyone who knew them what was going to happen. I was aware of it at the time and kept my distance. It wasn't hard."</p><h2>Where was Pat Tate from?</h2><p>According to reports, Pat Tate was born in Upminster, Essex.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>In 1995, Tate was found dead in the same county.</p><h2>What happened to Pat Tate?</h2><p>Pat Tate, Tony Tucker, and Craig Rolfe died after they were lured to a country lane in rural Essex, in what looked like a professional hit.</p><p>The three men, who were sat inside <a href=#>a Range Rover</a>, were&nbsp;shot in the head.</p><p>They were found the following morning by a farmer, having suffered multiple gunshot blasts.</p><p>The three victims had controlled the supply of ecstasy in the Basildon nightclub Raquels, where tragic <a href=#>Leah Betts</a> had taken the drug.</p><p>The teen was left in a coma after taking an ecstasy pill at her 18th birthday party and died 15 days later in hospital.</p><p>Her death led to a national outcry about drugs in nightclubs.</p><p>Five months after the slaying ex-BT engineer Darren Nicholls was caught with a drug haul.</p><p>Nicholls agreed to tell <a href=#>police</a> about who was responsible for the Rettendon murders, and that he had been the getaway driver.</p><p>In 1998, two men,&nbsp;<a href=#>Michael Steele</a> and <a href=#>Jack Whomes</a>, were <a href=#>jailed for life</a>&nbsp;for the triple murder that became known as one of the UK's biggest gangland executions, despite protesting their innocence.</p><p>Nicholls said Steele lured the trio to the lonely path as on the promise of a drugs deal before Whomes leapt out of bushes and the pair opened fire.</p><p>Nicholls was later given a whole new identity and placed in a safe house after providing evidence against the pair.</p><p>However, a three-part <a href=#>Sky</a> documentary, The Essex Murders, questioned whether police had the right men behind bars.</p><p>Former <a href=#>Met Police</a> detective David McKelvey claimed he had found <a href=#>new evidence</a> on the case.</p><p>Mr McKelvey, now of firm TM Eye, believes the new information <a href=#>casts doubt on the convictions</a>.</p><p>The lead initially came from a police informant known as 'Witness A' who claims he drove a hitman to the scene of the crime, as revealed by The Sun.</p><p>The tapes outline a sinister plot to take out Craig Rolfe, Pat Tate and Tony Tucker.</p><p>In a hotel room meeting, the anonymous figure said: “There was an armed robbery. The robbery is the key to it all really.</p><p>"It was a van full of cash, £495,000 got stolen. The whole thing was a balls up, if you like, because shortly after some of the robbers went splashing the money. It wasn’t long before everyone knew what happened.</p><p>“We got arrested and while we were in jail some of the money was given to Tony Tucker. It was given to him for safe-keeping.</p><p>“When we got out we asked for the money back but it wasn’t forthcoming and excuses were made, it’s tied up, this sort of thing, he couldn’t get it.</p><p>“By then he was drugged up, steroid upped, running around doing all sorts of business and in the end we knew it (the money) just wasn't coming back.</p><p>“He thought he was bigger than anyone. He thought there was nothing anyone could do. But he was wrong. A meeting was held and the problem solved.”</p><p>The fixer goes on to admit he paid the money to have them shot, adding: “I wasn’t bothered about the money, the money was irrelevant. It was the principal. Tucker was the target, the other two were collateral damage.”</p><p>Investigator and former Det Supt Dave McKelvey told The Sun: “I strongly believe there has been a miscarriage of justice.</p><p>“In the years that have passed, Whomes missed seeing his young children grow up while Steele is an old man who has become almost institutionalised.</p><p>“Times have moved on so much from when they were first jailed that when I mention <a href=#>social media</a> to Steele he has no idea what I’m talking about.”</p><p>Essex Police stand by the convictions.</p><p>A spokesperson for the force said: “There has been an exhaustive police investigation into the murders of Pat Tate, Tony Tucker and Craig Rolfe in Rettendon on 6 December 1995, which resulted in the conviction of Michael Steele and Jack Whomes for their murder.</p><p>“Since those convictions this case has been back before the <a href=#>Court of appeal</a> twice, in 1999 and 2006.</p><p>"These appeals have included focus upon the evidence of Witness A and the credibility of the key prosecution witness in the original trial.</p><p>"Both appeals were rejected and in 2006 Lord Justice Kay commented that there was no “element of unsafety” relating to the original convictions of both defendants.</p><p>"This case has also been reviewed by the Criminal Cases<br>Review Commission who, as recently as January 2023, took the decision not to refer this case back to the Court of<br>Appeal.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"We welcome this decision as this case has been exhaustively examined over the last 27 years and there remains no fresh evidence identified which would call the original verdicts into question.”</p><p>The triple murder inspired the 2000 film Essex Boys, starring Sean Bean, and The Rise of the Footsoldier franchise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ31yfpJsa2tnoJbBbsDArZxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
