He is also known for his work with Industrial Light and Magic on films including Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace and Star Wars: Episode II-Attack of the Clones. The Federation battleships and pod racers are some of Tory’s creations.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Tory Belleci’s Affairs</h2><p>That was a brief about his work but today we are here to take a peek into the personal life of this filmmaker. There were rumors flying around about Tory being gay. But he was quick to prove the allegations wrong by saying that he is straight and people spreading false news about him should get a life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In this matter, he was also supported by his ex-girlfriend Kari Byron. Kari stated that the allegations were stupid and ignorant. Tory and Kari were co-stars in the show Mythbusters. They did very well to hide that they were girlfriend and boyfriend, back when they were dating. It looks like Tory is a man who likes to keep his love affairs a secret and away from the media. Well, the former couple didn’t share anything about them, but it looks like they have managed to maintain a good relationship as friends even after the split. Now, Kari Byron is happily married to their husband Paul Urich for 10 years.</p><p>Well, we don’t have much information about his current relationship status. However, there were rumors of him dating a woman from his production house. But like his previous affair with Kari, Tory has done a magnificent job keeping it a secret.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www3.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/MAC+Cosmetics+Rick+Baker+Monster+Mash+EB6XhSA5y3wx.jpg alt ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Image: Is she the girl that Tory is dating right now?</strong></p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<a href=#>zimbio</a></strong></p><p>It was reported that Tory suffered a brief setback in his relationship with this new woman due the allegations regarding his sexual orientation. Tory even threatened to sue the activist for spreading such stupid rumors which caused misunderstanding between him and his secret girlfriend. But at the end of the day, he changed his mind and stated that he didn’t want to drop to the same level as those worthless people who started the rumor. Maybe he thought with a cool mind and we think it was a very smart move to just let it go.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Tory+Belleci+Antica+Pesa+Williamsburg+Grand+XDCYSm8wGzRl.jpg alt ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Image: Or is she Tory's new girlfriend?</strong></p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<a href=#>Zimbio</a></strong></p><p>When your fans grow simultaneously your haters also grow. Can we say if you are hated you are very successful and marching on the right path? Rightly, in Tory’s case, it definitely is relatable.</p><p>We just hope that he reveals his new girlfriend to his fans who are eagerly waiting to know about him. As far as we know, this couple is not engaged yet and we think Tory is a very career-oriented guy, so we think it will definitely take some time for him to settle down.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p>We wish Tory all the luck for his future and we hope to hear the good news soon about his marriage.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>What do you think about Tory?
