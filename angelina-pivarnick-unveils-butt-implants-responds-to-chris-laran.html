For those of you that know me very well you know that I always like to be truthful and I love to tell it straight," she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I was a little weary to post this because sometimes people can be haters and say some mean and cruel comments on my page," Pivarnick continued.</p><p>"I am still a human at the end of the day so please if you have nothing nice to say refrain from saying it. I am human and I have cellulite like many people. I am not perfect," Angelina went on.</p><p>"These results from @tutelaps BANDAID BUTTLIFT are AMAZING!! This pic is after session number two. All together I had three sessions!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"It took a few weeks to show results after each session. An updated picture is coming after all three sessions completed next week, Pivarnick continued (she’s really a fan of this procedure, in case you can’t tell).</p><p>"I cannot believe how amazing my new butt looks. I am not a candidate for a Brazilian butt lift so @tutelaps and I discussed injections and I’m sooo happy I did this," she added.</p><p>"He is amazing and he knew what would look best on me!! For anyone that is suffering from volume loss or hip dips and you don’t have enough fat to transfer to your butt then this is a great option for you!!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Some hip dip-sufferers were left a little confused about what exactly the procedure entails, so Angelina’s butt-sculptor, Dr. John Paul Tutela offered a more detailed explanation on his page.</p><p>“Sculptra is injected for a small volume butt lift or to fill in hip dips,”he wrote.</p><p>“It usually takes at least two to four treatments spaced six weeks apart.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Tutela also performed <a href=#>Angelina’s breast implant</a> surgery in 2018.</p><p>Now, it seems like Pivarnick braced herself for negative comments about her backside, but what she probably didn’t expect is allegations that her husband, Chris Larangeira, had been unfaithful.</p><p>“This is why Chris cheats!!!!!! She’s a pig and he knows it,” wrote one follower.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Lmfaooooo. Chris doesn’t cheat [you] lowlife loser. Who is this? One of my ex friends I kicked outta my life because [you] were a junk box,” Angelina shot back.&nbsp;</p><p>We guess that settles that!</p><p>Another follower accused Angelina of setting “yet another unrealistic beauty standard” with “dip hips.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Angelina kept her response technical, replying, “[You] mean HIP DIPS.”</p><p>Again, we guess she settled the score … although, to be honest, we’re not quite sure.</p><p>The real mystery here is why Angelina remains so hated.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Angelina Pivarnick or Kim Kardashian: A Bunch of Pics You Can’t Tell Apart!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>Our best guess is that many Shore fans continue to <a href=#>blame Angelina for Snooki’s retirement</a>.</p><p>The argument there is that if Angelina had not made such a big deal out of her castmates’ <a href=#>bridesmaids’ speech</a> at her wedding, Snooks would still be on the show.</p><p>We guess that makes sense — but there are better places to voice your complaints than on the woman’s plastic surgery before-and-after pics.</p><p>After all, it couldn’t have been easy for Angelina to post these.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2Z9cK3NoJyloZ6WerG11Zqpp6GToHq2utWeoKWrXZfCtcCMoqSppJGjwbR50Z6qqaeemcBuwM5mmqGqmah6ra3RmqVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
