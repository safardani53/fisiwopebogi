"What Night Teeth maybe seeks to do, at least from my perspective, is to build upon that and say, "Okay, we get it. Yes, vampires are cool and have power and control. Now, what is the mess that comes with that?"</p><p>"What are the human factors?" Debby added. "Pride, greed, lust, all of those things that come through and can really be the undoing of such a formidable empire. Maybe the difference is humanity. But also, the soundtrack is sick, the cast is sick. It's funny. It's visually cool."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Debby Ryan and Josh Dun married on New Year's Eve in 2019.</h2><p>Debby tied the knot with musician Josh Dun (of Twenty One Pilots fame) on New Year's Eve in 2019 in Austin, Tex.
