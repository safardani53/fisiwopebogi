If it's something they're passionate about, they'll labor tirelessly until they achieve it. They have a long life full of vitality and wonder about the world.

Cancers are extremely perceptive, and their psychic powers materialize in physical settings. However, like the hard-shelled crabs, this water sign is eager to go to any length to defend itself emotionally.
