It’s one of the worst feelings in the whole world."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000449620815.jpg><p>The newly engaged bounty hunter also said that he had his reservations about filming after Beth relapsed and it was discovered that her initial <a href=#>throat cancer had spread</a>.</p><p>"I didn’t necessarily like it [the idea of filming]. It was her, she wanted to do it… ‘cause we had talks," the father of 12 explained.</p><p>"I said, 'Beth, it’s not… you don’t have to show people this,' and she’s like, 'I do want to, I want to show 'em' – so it was mostly for her, because she wanted to show it.</p><p>"Personally, me? I wouldn’t have done that, but she wanted it so she got it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000535362948.jpg><p>"But what I noticed about it was when we were not filming, she was sick, right? But when we were filming, she forgot about it and she was out there laughing … that was the main thing, I could see that it was helping her to stay working, to keep her mind off of that, so that meant a lot and was a big part of the filming of the show."</p><p>After Beth's passing, Dog went into a deep depression where most conversations about Beth made him tear up.</p><p>"I barely remember the first six months after Beth passed away,” the reality TV star admitted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000574796087.jpg><p>"The last episode, it was right after she passed, a couple weeks, right? So you’re grieving and you’re freaked out and you don’t know what’s happening … but after that, when everything calms down, and people quit calling you, and flowers quit coming to the door and all of a sudden you’re alone … that’s when it hit me.</p><p>"You don’t want to have to go through it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000483259815.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000597621787.png><p>Dog then explained that despite him reading up on how to grieve the loss of a spouse, it didn't really help.</p><p>He said: "All of us are human, so there are certain things that we go through.</p><p>"I read 'em all and I tried to tell myself, 'You’re not gonna do that' – like, for instance, you blame the person that passed away, you blame them for dying.</p><p>"I was like, 'I’m not gonna do that …' and then one day I looked at Heaven and said, 'What the hell, why did you leave me here?' and I was swearing at her, and then I’m like, 'Oh God, I can’t do this' – so no matter what you do or who you are, whatever kind of superstar you think you are, you’re going to feel certain things."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000597244722.jpg><p>The former bail bondsman&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sobbed on live TV</a>&nbsp;as he said he would have wanted Beth to move on with a new man if he had died instead.</p><p>In a recent interview with Katie Souza,&nbsp;Duane&nbsp;tried to reason with fans who questioned whether he was moving too fast after the death of Beth.</p><p>The 67-year-old bounty hunter asked as he held back tears: "Let's put it like – what if it was Dog that died?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000601579448-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000584003067-3.jpg><p>"And what if it was Beth who met a Christian man that spoke in a heavenly language?
