Easy to understand.</p><p>The <a href=#>2016 election results</a> weren’t known yet, but when&nbsp;Bethenny asked Ramona if she was going to attend Carole’s election party?</p><p>Polls accurately predicted awkwardness, bigly.</p><p>Ramona said that Carole had been too aggressive about politics, but Bethenny&nbsp;said no one who wasn’t "very informed" got an invite.</p><p>The ladies enjoyed a good chuckle over how intense Carole is about politics before Ramona asked Bethenny&nbsp;about another controversy:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/ramona-singer-in-black.jpg><p>Ramona posed the not-scripted-whatsoever question:</p><p>Had anyone had approached Frankel’s daughter, Bryn, about Bethenny’s alleged nude movie role that recently surfaced in the tabloids?</p><p>Yes, there is an alleged <a href=#>Bethenny Frankel sex tape</a>.</p><p>Well … it’s more like a nude scene in a video, but you get the idea. It’s salacious, and Singer could not resist putting her on the spot.</p><p>Frankel wasn’t having it for a second though.</p><p>"Ramona attempting to embarrass me through my daughter who is in first grade is even low for Ramona, which is a new low," she said.</p><p>"Because ‘Ramona low’ is low already."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/luann-de-lesseps-attends-school-of-visual-arts-presents-language.jpg><p>"I don’t regret it at all!" Bethenny replied when Luann told her not to worry about it. "I needed the money, and I wanted to be an actress."</p><p>Ramona added that "in life, things happen for a reason," but Bethenny retorted, "Good friends should be able to ask each other questions."</p><p>Luann later suggested to Ramona that Bethenny might be embarrassed by her question (ya think) but Bethenny overheard and snapped.</p><p>"I think your attitude is unacceptable!" Ramona retaliated, at which point Carole delivered the ultimate insult, comparing Ramona to Trump.</p><p>Told you she had politics on the brain.</p><p>Singer went on to call Frankel out: "You may be good with business, but you know what? You’re really not good at interacting with people."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Luann agreed with her there, telling Frankel that she’s a very selfish person: "You don’t care about any of us! You only care about yourself!"</p><p>Ramona then called Bethenny a "B-I" (short for a word that begins with those two letters and ends with three more), as well as a "witch."</p><p>Bethenny&nbsp;got fed up and walked out.</p><p>The next day, at the inevitable rehashing,&nbsp;Luann, Ramona and Dorinda&nbsp;met up and Ramona insisted she did nothing wrong in the least.</p><p>"I don’t think that Bethenny likes when people point out the cracks, and Ramona pointed out a crack," Dorinda said, with a major caveat.</p><p>Singer’s timing, delivery and attitude? Not the best. Trump-like at times, which can rub people the wrong way if you’re supposedly friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Dorinda was more focused on Sonja, though.</p><p>She claimed that her co-star was "on a slanderous rampage" against her … while Sonja acted like nothing was wrong between them.</p><p>Vintage Real Housewives, in other words.</p><p>At Singer’s dinner party,&nbsp;Dorinda&nbsp;told Carole that she had a "mole" who had researched Sonja’s activities and given her a file on her.</p><p>Yes, basically an opposition research file "several inches thick" containing pretty much everything Morgan had ever said and/or done.</p><p>Medley could barely contain her excitement for when Sonja arrived and she could start lobbing some of these fun facts at her frenemy.</p><p>Stay tuned for next week.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>16 Reasons Why You Need a Best Friend Like Sonja Morgan</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WBcMDHnmSrnZGheqm71KycsKGmmsBuu8VmpZ6vXa68s7eMnKCtsV2nsqStz2aYZqaVrHqtu9Zo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
