The message read, “Hi, it’s Ye. May I call you about clearing ‘New Body’ on the album?” The “Jesus Walks” rapper even tagged Nicki in his tweet. Not only that, but he was seen putting her on blast in a now-viral social media video.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p lang=und dir=ltr>. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@NICKIMINAJ</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/gn9jijEpVD</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>— ye (@kanyewest) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>December 15, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I made that girl rewrite her verse three times for ‘Monster,’” Ye said to a crowd of people. “I supported her career.

The track was leaked in 2019. Its lyrics promote a person’s “new body” after getting plastic surgery, which fueled rumors that the song was a tribute to Ye’s now-ex-wife <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Kim Kardashian</b></a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>In one of the verses, Ye raps, “New ass, new tits, new bitch, who this?” and the chorus reportedly reads, “Can’t wait to see your new body / Don’t be actin’ like you don’t know nobody / No body count on your new body / I’ll be the first one to hit your new body.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>For Nicki’s original verse, she rapped, “Ayo, you ain’t f**k me, you f**ked the old body / You ain’t f**k Nicki, you f**ked Nicole body / Ain’t no miles on this here new body / Off with they heads, these bitches is nobodies.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>After the track was leaked, Ye publicly explained that he was trying to re-work the lyrics to be less sexually explicit for his album <i>Jesus Is King</i>. However, Nicki claimed that she had already written “three different verses” and wasn’t seeing “eye to eye” with the “Stronger” artist anymore, according to<i> Page Six</i>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>In 2020, though, Nicki’s originally recorded verse went viral on TikTok, which seemingly prompted her to ask Ye to consider releasing that version of the song. At the time, the “Starships” artist told Hot 106, “The public adored ‘New Body.’ … ‘New Body’ is the biggest hit record that never came out. Everybody knows that’s the hit that got away.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5BuZqehk6C2brnIp5ijq12nsqK%2Fzqdkp6ekYsGwecueq2ajkaPGpnnWnqqtZaKauaat0p5kp52nYq%2BwsNhmmqiknJavcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
