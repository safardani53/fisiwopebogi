Lake is best known for her role as noir in a 1940s film with Alan Ladd and her blushing hairstyle. In the late 1940s, Lake's career began to decline, partly due to his alcoholism. She only made one movie in the 1950s, but made several appearances on television. She returned to the big screen in 1966 in The Snow Footsteps, but the role failed to revive her career. Lake's memoir, Veronica: The Autobiography of Veronica Lake, was published in 1970. Her last on-screen role was in a low-budget horror film, Flesh Feast. After years of drinking, Lake died at the age of 50 in July 1973 of hepatitis and acute kidney injury.</p><table class=wikibox readability=10.5><tr readability=7><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Constance Frances Marie Ockelman, November 14, 1922, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>July 07, 1973, Burlington, Vermont, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Nationality</td><td class=wk_value>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Other names</td><td class=wk_value>Constance Keane, Connie Keane</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Education</td><td class=wk_value>St. Bernard's School (Saranac Lake, New York), Villa Maria, Miami High School</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1939–1954, 1966, 1970</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>4</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/veronica-lake-6sjk-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>Movie Actress Veronica Lake was born on November 14, 1922 in Brooklyn, New York, United States (She dies at the age of 50, on July 7, 1973).</p><p>In 1942, she sparked a fad by posing with her hair falling over one eye for the film This Gun for Hire.
