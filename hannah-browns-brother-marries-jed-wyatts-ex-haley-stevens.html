Because we love our family, we’re not gonna say anything. Or like you said, ‘You can’t choose your family,’ but the way that we grow up is so pivotal to these patterns that we find ourselves in. [It can be helpful] if you could write in words, what your relationship is like with your mom or was like with your mom or your dad or your siblings, and then you can connect the dots of some of the patterns that you might have in your life.”</p><p class=p1>Patrick, for his part, <a href=#>proposed to his now-wife in Mentone, Alabama, late last year</a>.</p><p class=p1>“12.18.21&nbsp;<span class=s1>✨</span>&nbsp;I said YES to forever with my best friend!!<span class=s1>✨</span>…and it was perfect,” Stevens captioned a December 2021 Instagram&nbsp;post, alongside engagement photos. “<span class=s1>💕</span>Thank you to everyone who made this day so special!

Both of us have kind of gone on our own journey of healing.”</p><p class=p1>Hannah — who is currently dating <a href=#><strong>Adam Woolard</strong></a> — was previously <a href=#>engaged to the country singer after he proposed</a> during the 2019 finale of&nbsp;<i>The Bachelorette</i>. The pair <a href=#>soon split amid allegations that Wyatt was already dating Stevens</a> when he joined the ABC dating show, though he has continually denied the claims. (Stevens, for her part, shared alleged text messages in which the Nashville resident <a href=#>had seemingly said “I love you” before leaving for filming</a>.)
