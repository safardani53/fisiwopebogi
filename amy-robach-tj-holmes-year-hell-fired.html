We failed at being good crisis managers, we failed at understanding some level of&nbsp;celebrity&nbsp;that neither one of us thought we had..."</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>television</a>&nbsp;star went on to reveal: "We were - threatened, I think, is the right way to put it with this - days before the first pictures were taken of us, the second week of November, we were directly threatened.</p><p>"I don't want to get into where it came from, but something was being demanded of us, and it was, 'If you don't do this, then we are gonna make it bad for you.' It was directly said to us."</p><p>He then divulged: "At that time we didn't see any urgency to it... but two days after that, sure enough, there was somebody unbeknownst to me parked outside my home, following me to work starting at 4am, and following us out of town for hours... following us all around.</p><p>"And I don't know how you prepare for something like that, but it was awful..."</p><p>The star then revealed that "sure enough," the&nbsp;<a href=#>news</a>&nbsp;broke the same weekend.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A SCARY WEEK</h2><p>In the same episode of the podcast, Amy recalled the moment she rushed to TJ's apartment <a href=#>fearing that he was dead</a> after news of their relationship broke.</p><p>She said TJ was in a "very dark space" the day after their affair first made headlines.</p><p>He was sending her messages that caused her to do what she called a "welfare check"&nbsp;on him.</p><p>The messages were in past tense as he told Amy about how she "was the love of his life" and that he was "sorry."</p><p>"You sent me a text basically saying 'I'm sorry. You were the love of my life. I'm so sorry this has happened.' You just kept saying you were sorry but you were using past tense," she said.</p><p>"I texted back saying, 'You're scaring me. Please tell me you're OK.' No response. I say, 'I'm calling you.' No answer."</p><p>TJ didn't pick up FaceTime calls either, which led Amy to rush to his apartment to check on him, with her father at her side.</p><p>That's where she found him "incoherent" on his bed.</p><p>"I was shaking," she said. "I remember going down the hall, opening the door, and I saw you ... and you were just sprawled out on your bed.</p><p>"I ran to you, I said, 'TJ,' and you didn't move."</p><p>She started crying as she recalled touching his body to "see if he was warm."</p><p>"I was so afraid," she said through tears. "You were just so incoherent."</p><p>TJ admitted that earlier that day, he was "pounding vodka" and eating an unknown amount of "weed edibles."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/tj-holmes-amy-robach-attend-865366160-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/gma3s-ousted-amy-robach-tj-862699838-5.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>KIDS IMPACTED</h2><p>In a different episode of the podcast, the couple confessed that it's been challenging<a href=#> for their kids</a> to accept their romance.</p><p>The former&nbsp;<a href=#>GMA 3</a>&nbsp;hosts took a question from a listener about what their bonds are like with their respective children.</p><p>Amy responded: "Evolving, is what I would say and we had relationships with each others' kids when we were just friends and so as tough as it's been for so many people in our lives, it's the most difficult for them because now they're having to look at us in a different way with one another.</p><p>"And we have been very thoughtful, and we've taken things very slowly, and we're being very patient.</p><p>"But things are good. They're peaceful and we want to continue to build on that."</p><p>Amy has two children – daughters&nbsp;<a href=#>Ava McIntosh</a>&nbsp;and Annie McIntosh – whom she shares with her ex Tim McIntosh.</p><p>Tj has a 10-year-old named Sabine whom he shares with his ex-wife <a href=#>Marilee Fiebig</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>EXES ON THE WARPATH</h2><p>On the same day the couple's podcast debuted, it was revealed that <a href=#>Marilee&nbsp;and Amy's ex-husband</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>Andrew Shue</a> were dating.</p><p>In a resurfaced picture, Marilee and Andrew both leaned in closely to one another as they smiled for the camera and even&nbsp;<a href=#>rested their heads</a>&nbsp;against each other.</p><p>An insider told <a href=# aria-label="Page Six (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> that Marilee and Andrew&nbsp;<a href=#>have been dating</a>&nbsp;for almost six months.</p><p>"It turned into something else, and they’re connected over their values. It’s bigger than&nbsp;the affair&nbsp;now," a source said.</p><p>Another source close to Amy reportedly told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>&nbsp;she "thinks her ex is trying to steal her thunder.”</p><p>“She’s convinced he did this to coincide with the debut of her podcast,” they said.</p><p>The source continued to say Amy is "livid."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>MOVING FORWARD</h2><p>On their podcast, TJ teased that he and Amy have taken the next step in their relationship and <a href=#>secretly tied the knot</a>.</p><p>During the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">episode</a>, the pair answered listeners' questions regarding their whirlwind romance.</p><p>One fan asked TJ if he'd consider getting matching tattoos with Amy, to which he had a shocking response.</p><p>After a brief pause, he replied: "How do you know we haven't already? We'll leave it at that.</p><p>"Getting a tattoo together. That's more of a commitment than marriage."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>After a few more awkward moments, TJ continued: "Should we just tell everybody? We've got tattoos, we're married, and we live together."</p><p>Amy laughed at her partner's comment, which could have hinted that his statement wasn't true.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/https-www-instagram-com-p-785344844-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/andrew-shue-amy-robach-attend-779492597.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/tj-holmes-amy-robach-celebrate-848458163-3.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaWeFc36QaJimsV2nvKOtwqFkraJdnbytucSsZLKdkad6qbHLpWSfoaKasXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
