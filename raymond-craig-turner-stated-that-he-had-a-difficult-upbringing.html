His upbringing was not ideal since he saw constant bickering between his parents. His mother was just 18 years old when he was born. After his mother’s relationship with Raymond ended, she started dating Ike and eventually married him. After his parents’ divorce, he moved in with his mother and stepfather. After marrying Ike, he was welcomed by his stepfather who lived with him and his other siblings.</p><p>He was often witnessing his parents’ conflicts. Her mother had to endure a lot of pain since Ike used to beat her up a lot. He used to mistreat her, which had a mental and emotional impact on Raymond.

He took his own life. Tina, his mother, was away from home for fashion week in Paris. He passed away at the age of 59. Tina had no clue why he killed himself since he was overjoyed because he had met his new girlfriend and was ready to present her to his mother on his birthday.&nbsp;He even got new employment, and his job and work were not the cause of his death. According to his mother, his son’s significant choice may have been motivated by loneliness.</p><h2>Tina has been through a lot in her life.</h2><p>She achieved a great deal after becoming famous. Nonetheless, she had to deal with a number of tragic events throughout her life. She did not have a great upbringing or marriage, and she also struggled in her work. Tina’s mother abandoned her and her family when she was eleven years old in search of a better life. Her father was also unsupportive.&nbsp;She grew up with her sisters, and they were all nurtured by their grandmother, and after she died, they moved to St. Louis. She used to go to clubs with her sisters and met Ike Turner there. She began singing from there. She even received her first recording under a different name. Her marriage to Ike was a failure because they were abusive to one other. She had to endure domestic violence.</p><p>Her violent relationship, as well as the torment she endured, resulted in a third-degree burn and a jaw fracture at one point. She finally chose to commit herself after dealing with this situation for a long time. She had had enough and filed for divorce from him. Ike said that he used to abuse her often. Tina said that she could never forgive him for everything he had done to her.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Raymond-Craig-Turner-1.jpg alt="Raymond Craig Turner" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He has left her with terrible memories that she will never be able to erase. In 2013, she married Erwin Bach. They left for Switzerland. Tina chose to give up her American passport and become a Swiss citizen. She was unable to walk after three months of marriage due to a stroke.&nbsp;She realized that she had colon cancer and that she had renal failure. Her spouse donated a kidney to her, and the surgery went well. Tina, on the other hand, continues to suffer from the severe negative effects of her therapies.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Child</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Raymond Craig Turner</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipmrGdpLulecKrmKKfXanCs7rEq2SsrJGpsqV506GYrWWYmnqprcNmmGacmZuzqq%2FUpatmraCXv6q6xqKloGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
