On Aug. 24, 2016, the Chargers released a statement announcing that Joey had rejected the “best offer” they could give, declaring that his rookie season was on the line because of the amount of training camp time he had missed. At that point, he was the only unsigned draft pick left from his class.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Joey is best known for playing defensive end&nbsp;for Ohio State University, also for being&nbsp;selected third overall in the 2016 NFL Draft.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>Joey was raised on football, as his dad John Bosa also played defensive end in the NFL for the Miami Dolphins from 1987 to 1989.
