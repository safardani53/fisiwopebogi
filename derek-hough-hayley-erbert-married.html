The symbolism of it was beautiful. We’re here, planting our seeds to grow our family.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Derek-Hough-Hayley-Erbert-ss-embed1-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>During their ceremony, Derek and Hayley exchanged personal and traditional vows. Hayley wore a custom wedding gown designed by<strong> Georgina Chapman</strong> from <strong>Marchesa</strong>. She walked down the aisle to a rendition of <strong>Richard Walters’</strong> “Unconditional” that the singer rewrote and recorded for the couple. The DWTS judge wore a <strong>Tom Ford</strong> suit for the ceremony.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The couple held their wedding reception in a 100-year-old barn. Famous names on the guest list included <strong>Jenna Johnson</strong>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shawn Johnson</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nina Dobrev</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shaun White</strong></a>, <strong>Alfonso Ribeiro</strong>, <strong>Freida Pinto</strong>, <strong>Amy Purdy</strong>, <strong>Robert</strong> and <strong>Kym Hejavec</strong>, and, of course, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Julianne Hough</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Derek and Hayley are both very accomplished dancers who met when Hayley joined Derek and Julianne’s MOVE Live Tour in 2014. Their paths then crossed again when Hayley was hired as a member of the DWTS <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>season 21&nbsp;</a>troupe, which ended up being another winning season for Derek, who was partnered with<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;<strong>Bindi Irwin</strong></a>. The couple began dating at some point after that but did not go public with their relationship until 2017.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The couple got engaged</a> after 7 years of dating in June 2022. “It’s only the beginning…the beginning of forever,” Derek captioned a beautiful photo of the proposal.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>HollywoodLife</strong> spoke EXCLUSIVELY</a> with the man who designed and brought the proposal to life, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Troy Williams</strong></a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Simply Troy Lifestyle + Events</a>, to learn all the behind-the-scenes details of the special moment. “I am very proud of how it turned out, and I adore them and love them very much. This happened in their living room,” he gushed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The first secret Troy spilled was that while the happy couple announced the news on June 2, Derek actually got down on one knee on May 23! He then revealed where it all happened. “He told me that he wanted candles and there were 250 candles. To be able to do that and surprise her, in their own living room, was really touching,” Troy noted.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Derek popped the question almost as soon as they walked in, according to Troy. He was there to witness the sweet moment, seen above, which was captured by New York City-based photographer,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Anée Atelier</strong></a>. <span>Derek also asked Hayley to be his wife with a sparkling oval diamond by Canadian jeweler, </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Paris Jewelers</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5FvZp2dopq4brTOrp6hZZiWxq2x2Gacq5qVp8FuucCrqaKdlGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
