In addition, he had no role model inspiring him to make the film. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>But all in all, his experience as an African-American man&nbsp;inspired him to make the movie.&nbsp;This experience goes way back to his childhood, where his parents' ethnicity built his fixation on race.</p><h2>Jordan Peele and His Parents' Ethnicity</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Peele was born on February 21, 1979, in New York City to mother Lucinda and father Hayward.
