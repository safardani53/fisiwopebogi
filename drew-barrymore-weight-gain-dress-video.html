The Hollywood legend and host of The Drew Barrymore Show said that “normally we do these like, cute pictures and we’re like, ‘Oh my god, look at this amazing outfit and look!’ Well. Here. Let me keep it real with ya.” From there, Drew turned around to embarrassingly reveal that her adorable skirt didn’t fit anymore.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Yeah, that happened,” the Scream star said, indicating the piece of elastic that was added for her skirt to fit. “I guess I’ve been eating my stress a little bit lately,” she added. “I have to have like, a brassiere thing put in there.” Despite this, Drew took the additional weight gain in stride while also giving some love to those dealing with their own <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“COVID 15</a>” battle. “So, I’m going to reevaluate my life this weekend, and for anyone who has to put an extender on your pants, well, just know, I feel ya!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Drew’s “wardrobe malfunction” comes after she started the year on the right foot, healthwise. In a series of videos and images posted to her Instagram account in February, Drew revealed she “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lost 20 pounds and trained like a mother.</a>” Drew credited her trainer, Marnie Alton, with her fitness success. “Her priorities are in the right place. She is humorous and so so so knowledgeable about our bodies. I love her. Inside and out. Her classes are always booked up, and we all love to run to her for her spirit and leadership for all things healthy. We hope the people in the wellness world are actually healthy in their hearts and minds.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Drew-Barrymore-Weight-Gain-ap-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I eat really clean and healthy, and I do an hour of Pilates at least four days a week,” Drew said when detailing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her fitness journey</a> in the August issue of InStyle. “I have to work so hard at not being the size of a bus. And it’s OK. That is just my journey. That is my karma. I don’t know, maybe I was thin and mean in a past life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Of course, 2020 happened, with COVID-19, pandemics, political elections, and more things to make someone put on a few pounds. Drew, along with running her talk show, also has been homeschooling her daughters <strong>Olive</strong> and <strong>Frankie</strong>. “I felt very overwhelmed at first — and I hate feeling overwhelmed. It was weird to be a mom and a teacher and a provider and a friend. I felt sad for a while that I was all I could offer my children. Then I realized that I had to get out from under it. I have so much empathy and patience for everyone but myself, it’s sick.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze49tZp2qlax6o63Rq7Cmp6KaerixyKCfrWWXlravecOrnKyrXau2pbHOaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
